Petronet seeks more LNG under long-term Qatar deal

Petronet LNG, India's top gas importer, will seek up to 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) when it renews its long-term deal with Qatar this year, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.

"We are seeking an additional 0.75 to 1 mtpa on top of existing 8.5 mtpa contact," Chief Executive A.K. Singh told reporters on the sidelines of the Indian Energy Week conference.

Petronet, which is currently purchasing LNG from Qatar at $16 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu), has until the end of this year to renew its deal.

India's LNG imports fell for the second straight year in 2022, mainly due to fewer imports by utilities as the country ramped up coal-fired power production at the expense of natural gas.

The energy-hungry nation expects deeper penetration of city gas distribution to drive LNG demand in the coming years.

Petronet, which is currently purchasing 1.42 mtpa of LNG from Exxon Mobil Corp's Gorgon project in Australia, will receive an additional 0.6 mtpa under the deal from 2025-26, Sin ..

ONGC to reverse oil, gas output decline; sees 18% jump in production in FY25

India's largest oil and gas producer ONGC will this year reverse years of decline in production and gradually raise output thereafter, as it invests billions of dollars to produce from newer discoveries, a top company official said. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in fiscal 2021-22 produced 21.707 million tonne of crude oil, which is refined to produce petroleum products like petrol and diesel, and 21.68 billion cubic metre (bcm) of natural gas, which is used to produce electricity, manufacture fertiliser and as CNG in automobiles.

"We are definitely looking forward to increasing production of oil and gas in 2023-24 and even in the current year," ONGC chairman Arun Kumar Singh told PTI.

In the current fiscal year (2022-23), crude oil production is slated to rise to 22.823 million tonnes and gas to 22.099 bcm. In the following fiscal year, oil production will climb to 24.636 million tonnes and 25.689 million tonnes in 2024-25.
