Crude oil, also known as oil in some contexts, is essential for a modern economy. With crude oil, economies can produce petroleum products that power gasoline vehicles and generate electricity. Economies can also use petroleum as feedstock to make products such as plastics, polyurethane, and many other intermediate and end-user goods.

In the United States for 2021, the transportation sector used up 67% of the total crude oil consumed, the industrial sector used up 27%, and the residential, commercial, and electric power sector used up 6%.

Given it is essential for a modern economy, the world makes a lot of crude oil.

According to BP, the total oil production in the world was 89.88 million barrels per day in 2021, up from 88.49 million barrels per day in 2020 but lower than the oil production of 94.92 million barrels per day in 2019.

In addition, the world also produced 12.05 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids in 2021, up from 11.70 million barrels per day in 2020 but down from 11.79 million barrels per day in 2019.

In 2021, global oil production increased by 1.4 million barrels per day with OPEC+ countries accounting for over three fourths of the rise. OPEC is an organization of some of the world's major oil exporting countries and OPEC+ is the same organization in addition to countries like Russia.
One reason for the increase in production was that oil prices averaged $70.91 per barrel in 2021, with the price being one of the highest averages for a year since 2015.
Despite the increase from 2020, however, oil consumption in 2021 was still 3.7 million barrels per day below 2019 levels. According to BP, aviation related oil demand was 2.5 million barrels per day lower in 2021 than in 2019 as fewer people flew last year given the pandemic.
2022 : Given that air travel has recovered further in 2022, it is likely that oil production in 2022 will be higher than it was in 2021. According to the International Air Transport Association, passenger traffic was 74% of pre-pandemic levels in September of 2022, a rise of 57% year over year. In October, OPEC also forecasted that oil demand to increase 2.64 million bpd  in 2022 and another 2.34 million bpd in 2023.

Furthermore, oil prices have increased due to the economic recovery from the pandemic and the Russia Ukraine war. According to a survey of economists and analysts, Brent crude could average $100.5 per barrel this year according to Reuters in November 30. According to the EIA in the beginning of December, the WTI spot average could average $95.22 per barrel in 2022 as well.

With the higher prices, oil producing nations have incentive to produce more. If total oil production in the world is higher, it is likely that some of the leading nations in OPEC have increased their oil production this year. In terms of the United States, the EIA believes that U.S. oil production will average 11.7 million barrels per day in 2022 versus 11.25 million barrels per day in 2021.
Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially this year, however, economic growth could slow next year and oil demand might not be as strong as expected in 2023. Indeed, OPEC+ cut oil production in October although it decided against cutting production further in December.
