India's future prosperity will hinge on affordable, clean and reliable energy... 
India has seen extraordinary successes in its recent energy development, but many 
challenges remain, and the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major disruption. In recent 
years, India has brought electricity connections to hundreds of millions of its citizens; 
promoted the adoption of highly-efficient LED lighting by most households; and prompted a 
massive expansion in renewable sources of energy, led by solar power. The gains for Indian 
citizens and their quality of life have been tangible. However, the Covid-19 crisis has 
complicated efforts to resolve other pressing problems. These include a lack of reliable 
electricity supply for many consumers; a continued reliance on solid biomass, mainly 
firewood, as a cooking fuel for some 660 million people; financially ailing electricity 
distribution companies, and air quality that has made Indian cities among the most polluted 
in the world.  
And the scope for further growth in energy demand and infrastructure is huge 
India is the world's third-largest energy consuming country, thanks to rising incomes and 
improving standards of living. Energy use has doubled since 2000, with 80% of demand still 
being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. On a per capita basis, India's energy use and 
emissions are less than half the world average, as are other key indicators such as vehicle 
ownership, steel and cement output. As India recovers from a Covid-induced slump in 2020, 
it is re-entering a very dynamic period in its energy development. Over the coming years, 
millions of Indian households are set to buy new appliances, air conditioning units and 
vehicles. India will soon become the world's most populous country, adding the equivalent 
of a city the size of Los Angeles to its urban population each year. To meet growth in 
electricity demand over the next twenty years, India will need to add a power system the 
size of the European Union to what it has now.  
India has a wide range of possible energy futures before it 
This special report maps out possible energy futures for India, the levers and decisions 
that bring them about, and the interactions that arise across a complex energy system. 
The increasing urgency driving the global response to climate change is a pivotal theme. 
India has so far contributed relatively little to the world's cumulative greenhouse gas 
emissions, but the country is already feeling their effects. This report's analysis is based on 
a detailed review of existing or announced energy reforms and targets. These include the 
aims of quadrupling renewable electricity capacity by 2030, more than doubling the share 
of natural gas in the energy mix, enhancing energy efficiency and transport infrastructure, 
increasing domestic coal output, and reducing reliance on imports. Progress towards these 
policy goals varies across our report's different scenarios, none of which is a forecast. Our 
aim is rather to provide a coherent framework in which to consider India's choices and their 
implications. 
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) provides a balanced assessment of the direction 
in which India's energy system is heading, based on today's policy settings and 
constraints and an assumption that the spread of Covid-19 is largely brought under 
control in 2021.  
The India Vision Case is based on a rapid resolution of today's public health crisis and a 
more complete realisation of India's stated energy policy objectives, accompanied by a 
faster pace of economic growth than in the STEPS. 
The Delayed Recovery Scenario analyses potential downside risks to India's energy 
and economic development in the event that the pandemic is more prolonged. 
The Sustainable Development Scenario explores how India could mobilise an 
additional surge in clean energy investment to produce an early peak and rapid 
subsequent decline in emissions, consistent with a longer-term drive to net zero, while 
accelerating progress towards a range of other sustainable development goals. 
Covid-19 will leave lasting scars 
Prior to the global pandemic, India's energy demand was projected to increase by almost 
50% between 2019 and 2030, but growth over this period is now closer to 35% in the 
STEPS, and 25% in the Delayed Recovery Scenario. The latter would put some of India's 
hard-won gains in the fight against energy poverty at risk, as lower-income households are 
forced to fall back on more polluting and inefficient sources of energy. It would also extend 
the slump in energy investment, which we estimate to have fallen by some 15% in India in 
2020. Even though the pandemic and its aftermath could temporarily suppress emissions, 
as coal and oil bear the brunt of the reduction in demand, it does not move India any closer 
to its long-term sustainable development goals. 
India's size and dynamism will keep it at the heart of the global energy system 
An expanding economy, population, urbanisation and industrialisation mean that India 
sees the largest increase in energy demand of any country, across all of our scenarios to 
2040. India's economic growth has historically been driven mainly by the services sector 
rather than the more energy-intensive industrial sector, and the rate at which India has 
urbanised has also been slower than in other comparable countries. But even at a relatively 
modest assumed urbanisation rate, India's sheer size means that 270 million people are still 
set to be added to India's urban population over the next two decades. This leads to rapid 
growth in the building stock and other infrastructure. The resulting surge in demand for a 
range of construction materials, notably steel and cement, highlights the pivot in global 
manufacturing towards India. In the STEPS, as India develops and modernises, its rate of 
energy demand growth is three times the global average. 
The Indian electricity sector is on the cusp of a solar-powered revolution... 
Solar power is set for explosive growth in India, matching coal's share in the Indian power 
generation mix within two decades in the STEPS - or even sooner in the Sustainable 
Development Scenario. As things stand, solar accounts for less than 4% of India's electricity 
generation, and coal close to 70%. By 2040, they converge in the low 30%s in the STEPS, 
and this switch is even more rapid in other scenarios. This dramatic turnaround is driven by 
India's policy ambitions, notably the target to reach 450 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, 
and the extraordinary cost-competitiveness of solar, which out-competes existing coal-fired 
power by 2030 even when paired with battery storage. The rise of utility-scale renewable 
projects is underpinned by some innovative regulatory approaches that encourage pairing 
solar with other generation technologies, and with storage, to offer "round the clock" 
supply. Keeping up momentum behind investments in renewables also means tackling risks 
relating to delayed payments to generators, land acquisition, and regulatory and contract 
uncertainty. However, the projections in the STEPS do not come close to exhausting the 
scope for solar to meet India's energy needs, especially for other applications such as 
rooftop solar, solar thermal heating, and water pumps. 
while rising demand for air-conditioning pushes up the peak in power demand 
India's electricity demand is set to increase much more rapidly than its overall energy 
demand. But a defining feature of the outlook is a sharp rise in variability - both in 
electricity output, from solar PV and wind, and in daily consumption. On the supply side, 
output from renewables in some Indian states is set to exceed demand on a regular basis 
(typically around the middle of the day) before 2030. On the demand side, the key 
contributor to variability comes from rapid growth in ownership of air-conditioning units. 
Energy efficiency measures targeting both cooling appliances and buildings avoid around a 
quarter of the potential growth in consumption in the STEPS, but electricity demand for 
cooling still increases six-fold by 2040, creating a major early evening peak in electricity use. 
India requires a massive increase in power system flexibility 
The pace of change in the electricity sector puts a huge premium on robust grids and 
other sources of flexibility, with India becoming a global leader in battery storage. India 
has a higher requirement for flexibility in its power system operation than almost any other 
country in the world. In the near term, India's large grid and its coal-fired power fleet meet 
the bulk of India's flexibility needs, supported by hydropower and gas-fired capacity. Going 
forward, new power lines and demand-side options - such as improving the efficiency of air 
conditioners or shifting the operation of agricultural pumps to different parts of the day - 
will need to play a much greater role. But battery storage is particularly well suited to the 
short-run flexibility that India needs to align its solar-led generation peak in the middle of 
the day with the country's early evening peak in demand. By 2040, India has 140 GW of 
battery capacity in the STEPS, the largest of any country, and close to 200 GW in the 
Sustainable Development Scenario.  
As solar takes power, the focus for coal switches to industry.
Coal's hold over India's power sector is loosening, with industry accounting for most of 
the increase in coal demand to 2040 in the STEPS. Once the coal-fired power plants 
currently under construction are completed over the next few years, there is no net growth 
at all in India's coal fleet. Coal-fired generation was most exposed to the dip in electricity 
consumption in 2020. It picks up slightly in the STEPS as demand recovers, since renewables 
do not cover all of the projected increase in electricity demand. However, coal suppliers 
looking for growth increasingly have to turn to India's industrial consumers rather than the 
power sector. The share of coal in the overall energy mix steadily declines in the STEPS, 
from 44% in 2019 to 34% in 2040, and more rapidly in other scenarios. 
while oil continues to dominate a fast-growing transport sector in the STEPS 
Energy demand for road transport in the STEPS is projected to more than double over the 
next two decades, although this growth is cut dramatically in the Sustainable 
Development Scenario. Over half of the growth in the STEPS is fuelled by diesel-based 
freight transport. An extra 25 million trucks are travelling on India's roads by 2040 as road 
freight activity triples, and a total of 300 million vehicles of all types are added to India's 
fleet between now and then. Transport has been the fastest-growing end-use sector in 
recent years, and India is set for a huge expansion of transportation infrastructure - from 
highways, railways and metro lines to airports and ports. Today's policy settings are 
sufficient to prevent runaway growth in transport energy demand. And some parts of the 
system shift rapidly to less energyintensive options, with one example being a strong 
increase in the use of two-or-threewheeled vehicles for road transport. Nonetheless, in the 
STEPS, India's oil demand rises by almost 4 million barrels per day (mb/d) to reach 8.7 mb/d 
in 2040, the largest increase of any country. In the Sustainable Development Scenario, by 
contrast, a much stronger push for electrification, efficiency and fuel switching limits 
growth in oil demand to less than 1 mb/d.  
India's building spree will shape its energy use for years to come 
India is set to more than double its building space over the next two decades, with 70% of 
new construction happening in urban areas. The model of urbanisation that India follows 
and the extent to which new construction follows energy-efficient building codes will shape 
patterns of energy use far into the future. The shift towards urban living accelerates 
transitions in residential energy use away from solid biomass and towards electricity and 
modern fuels. Buoyed by rising appliance ownership and demand for cooling, the share of 
electricity in residential energy use nearly triples. Nonetheless, in the STEPS, firewood and 
other traditional fuels are still widely used for cooking by 2030. It would take an additional 
push - as in the India Vision Case and the Sustainable Development Scenario - to move all 
households to LPG, improved cook stoves, gas or electricity. 
Today's clean energy momentum enables India to outperform its Paris pledges 
In the STEPS, India exceeds the goals set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC) under the Paris Agreement. The emissions intensity of India's economy improves by 
40% from 2005 to 2030, above the 33-35% set out in its existing NDC. And the share of 
nonfossil fuels in electricity generation capacity reaches almost 60%, well above the 40% 
that India pledged. India's leadership in the deployment of clean energy technologies 
expands its market for solar PV, wind turbine and lithium-ion battery equipment to over 
$40 billion per year in the STEPS by 2040. As a result, 1 in every 7 dollars spent worldwide 
on these three types of equipment in 2040 is in India, compared with 1 in 20 today. India's 
clean energy workforce grows by 1 million over the next ten years. If the approach 
embodied in today's policies can be realised in full, as in the India Vision Case, higher 
economic growth than in the STEPS need not mean higher energy demand and emissions. 
In this Case, and especially in the Sustainable Development Scenario where the equipment 
market for solar, wind, batteries and water electrolysers rises to $80 billion per year, the 
industrial and commercial opportunities from clean energy are even larger.  
The path to a "gas-based economy" is not fully mapped out 
The market for natural gas is growing fast in India, but its role varies by sector, by 
scenario and over time. The 6% share of natural gas in India's current energy mix is among 
the lowest in the world. It almost doubles in the STEPS as gas use rises in the industrial 
sector and in city gas distribution. In the India Vision Case, natural gas also helps to displace 
coal in power generation, bringing India's aspiration of a "gas-based economy" closer still. 
However, affordability is a sensitive issue for consumers, especially given the complex 
patchwork of additional charges and tariffs that, on average, doubled the cost of wholesale 
gas by the time it reached end-users in 2019. As India builds out its gas infrastructure, 
natural gas can find multiple uses in India's energy system, including to help meet air 
quality and near-term emissions goals if supply chains are managed responsibly. But the 
Sustainable Development Scenario also underlines that a long-term vision for gas needs to 
incorporate a growing role for biogases and low-carbon hydrogen, for which India has large 
potential. 
India's faces energy security hazards ahead 
India's combined import bill for fossil fuels triples over the next two decades in the STEPS, 
with oil by far the largest component, pointing to continued risks to India's energy 
security. Domestic production of oil and gas continues to fall behind consumption trends 
and net dependence on imported oil rises above 90% by 2040, up from 75% today. This 
continued reliance on imported fuels creates vulnerabilities to price cycles and volatility as 
well as possible disruptions to supply. Energy security hazards could arise in India's 
domestic market as well, notably in the electricity sector if the necessary flexibility in power 
system operation does not materialise. An additional systemic threat to the reliability of 
electricity supply comes from the poor financial health of many electricity distribution 
companies. Improving the cost-reflectiveness of tariffs, the efficiency of billing and 
collection and reducing technical and commercial losses are key to reforming this sector.  
Booming industry and transport push up CO2 emissions and harm air quality 
A 50% rise in India's CO2 emissions to 2040 is the largest of any country in the STEPS, even 
though India's per capita CO2 emissions remain well below the global average. The 
increase in India's emissions is enough to offset entirely the projected fall in emissions in 
Europe over the same period. The remarkable rise of renewables arrests the growth in 
India's power sector emissions in the STEPS, although this still leaves the coal-fired fleet - 
the fifth-largest single category of emissions worldwide today - as a major emitter of CO2. 
Alongside the option of early retirement in some cases, this puts a strong premium on 
policy approaches that can retool this fleet for more limited and flexible operation and/or 
on technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). But the main 
reasons for the increase in India's CO2 emissions in the STEPS lie outside the power sector, 
in industry and transport (especially from trucks). These two sectors are also responsible for 
a much larger share of air pollutant emissions than the power sector in the STEPS, and a 
rising urban population means that more people are exposed to air pollution and suffer its 
ill effects. Water stress is likewise an increasingly important factor for India's energy sector 
and its technology choices. 
All roads to successful global clean energy transitions go via India... 
As the world seeks ways to accelerate the pace of transformation in the energy sector, 
India is in a unique position to pioneer a new model for low-carbon, inclusive growth. 
Many aspects of such a model are already evident in India's policy vision, and many more 
are highlighted in the Sustainable Development Scenario that points the way for India 
towards net-zero emissions. If this can be done, it will show the way for a whole group of 
energyhungry developing economies, by demonstrating that robust economic expansion is 
fully compatible with an increasing pace of emissions reductions and the achievement of 
other development goals. India is already a global leader in solar power - and solar 
combined with batteries will play a massive part in India's energy future. But India will need 
a whole host of technologies and policies to chart this new path. As new industrial sectors 
emerge and clean energy jobs grow, India will also need to ensure that no one is left 
behind, including in those regions that are heavily dependent on coal today. 
and India's energy destiny will be forged by government policies 
More than that of any other major economy, India's energy future depends on buildings 
and factories yet to be built, and vehicles and appliances yet to be bought. Within 20 
years, the majority of India's emissions in the STEPS come from power plants, industrial 
facilities, buildings and vehicles that do not exist today. This represents a huge opening for 
policies to steer India onto a more secure and sustainable course. India's ambitious 
renewables targets are already acting as a catalyst for the transformation of its power 
sector. A crucial - and even more challenging - task ahead is to put the industrial sector on 
a similarly new path through more widespread electrification, material and energy 
efficiency, technologies such as CCUS, and a switch to progressively lower-carbon fuels. 
Electrification, efficiency and fuel switching are also the main tools for the transport sector, 
alongside a determined move to build more sustainable transport infrastructure and shift 
more freight onto India's soon-tobe-electrified railways. These transformations require 
innovation, partnerships and capital. The additional capital required for clean energy 
technologies to 2040 in the Sustainable 
Development Scenario is $1.4 trillion above the level in the STEPS. But the benefits are 
huge, including savings of the same magnitude on oil import bills. Government policies to 
accelerate India's clean energy transition can lay the foundation for lasting prosperity and 
greater energy security. The stakes could not be higher, for India and for the world. 


India is a major force in the global energy economy. Energy consumption has more 
than doubled since 2000, propelled upwards by a growing population - soon to be 
the world's largest - and a period of rapid economic growth. Near-universal 
household access to electricity was achieved in 2019, meaning that over 900 million 
citizens have gained an electrical connection in less than two decades.  
India's continued industrialisation and urbanisation will make huge demands of its 
energy sector and its policy makers. Energy use on a per capita basis is well under 
half the global average, and there are widespread differences in energy use and the 
quality of service across states and between rural and urban areas. The affordability 
and reliability of energy supply are key concerns for India's consumers.  
The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted India's energy use; our updated assessment 
shows an estimated fall of about 5% in the country's energy demand in 2020 due to 
lockdowns and related restrictions, with coal and oil use suffering the biggest falls. 
The pandemic has also hit investment in the energy sector, which fell by an 
estimated 15% in 2020, exacerbating financial strains across the board, in particular 
among India's electricity distribution companies. How long the impacts last will 
depend on how quickly the spread of the virus is brought under control, and on the 
policy responses and recovery strategies that are put in place. 
Rising population and incomes since 2000 have underpinned a doubling of energy use 
in India, but per capita energy use is still less than 40% of the world average. 
 
Over 80% of India's energy needs are met by three fuels: coal, oil and solid biomass. 
Coal has underpinned the expansion of electricity generation and industry, and 
remains the largest single fuel in the energy mix. Oil consumption and imports have 
grown rapidly on account of rising vehicle ownership and road transport use. 
Biomass, primarily fuelwood, makes up a declining share of the energy mix, but is 
still widely used as a cooking fuel. Despite recent success in expanding coverage of 
LPG in rural areas, 660 million Indians have not fully switched to modern, clean 
cooking fuels or technologies. 
Natural gas and modern renewable sources of energy have started to gain ground, 
and were least affected by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The rise of 
solar PV in particular has been spectacular; the resource potential is huge, ambitions 
are high, and policy support and technology cost reductions have quickly made it the 
cheapest option for new power generation. 
India is the third-largest global emitter of CO2, despite low per capita CO2 emissions. 
The carbon intensity of its power sector in particular is well above the global 
average. Additionally, particulate matter emissions are a major factor in air 
pollution, which has emerged as one of India's most sensitive social and 
environmental issues: in 2019, there were well over one million premature deaths 
related to ambient and household air pollution.  
India has a wide range of policies in place that aim to bring about a secure and 
sustainable energy future. This Outlook does not have a single view on how India's 
energy future might look. Instead, based on a detailed examination of today's 
energy markets, technologies and policies, our scenarios explore the implications of 
different circumstances and choices, and the linkages between them.  
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) assumes that the pandemic is gradually 
brought under control in 2021. Against that backdrop, it assesses the direction in 
which today's policy settings and targets seem likely to take the energy sector in 
India, taking into account a range of real-life constraints that might affect their 
realisation in practice. 
The India Vision Case (IVC) takes a more optimistic stance on the speed of economic 
recovery and long-term growth, and also on the prospects for a fuller 
implementation of India's stated energy policy ambitions. 
The Delayed Recovery Scenario (DRS), by contrast, examines the implications of a 
more prolonged pandemic with deeper and longer-lasting impacts on a range of 
economic, social and energy indicators than is the case in the STEPS. 
The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) takes a different approach, working 
backwards from specific international climate, clean air and energy access goals, 
including the Paris Agreement, and examining what combination of actions would 
be necessary to achieve them. 


It has been six years since the International Energy Agency (IEA) last completed a special 
focus on India in its World Energy Outlook series. This new report updates and expands the 
analysis of India, and it does so from the exceptional starting point of 2020. Many things 
have changed in India and in global energy since the last India Energy Outlook was 
published, but the Covid-19 pandemic has caused more disruption to the energy sector 
than any other event in recent history. The impacts will continue to be felt, in India and 
around the world, for years to come.  
However, while the pandemic affects the new Outlook in numerous ways, it does not alter 
the fundamental considerations underpinning this special focus on India. The potential for 
growth in energy demand and energy infrastructure in India remains enormous. How these 
needs are met will have a crucial impact on the aspirations of what will soon become the 
world's most populous country. It will also have a huge influence on global trends, including 
the prospects for a successful global response to climate change.  
As a result of the country's own efforts and the falling global costs of some key clean energy 
technologies, there is scope for India to chart a course for its energy development that is 
significantly less emissions-intensive than those followed by other countries in the past. In 
India, there are signs - especially in the power sector - that such a clean energy transition is 
under way. But there is still a wide range of possible ways in which it could play out, with 
much depending on near-term uncertainties over the pandemic and the shape of the 
economic recovery, as well as on the policy choices that India makes. The next decade will 
be critical to India's energy future, since many of the policy actions taken today - including 
short-term actions to manage the effects of the pandemic - are likely to have long-lasting 
consequences.  
Our aim in this new India Energy Outlook is not to prescribe these choices or to forecast the 
future, but rather to provide a coherent framework in which India's options can be 
assessed. And, while very different, there is one thing on which all our scenarios agree: 
whichever way the global energy economy evolves from here, India will be firmly at its 
centre.  
After this introductory chapter, which sets the scene, the remainder of this Outlook 
contains deep dives into topics that will define India's energy landscape in the coming 
years. Chapter 2 explores the key factors that will drive energy demand in India, including 
urbanisation, buildings, transport and industries. Chapter 3 looks at aspects of energy 
supply, including transformations in the power sector, the potential for natural gas in 
India's economy, and the role of bioenergy and coal in a rapidly changing energy system. 
The final chapter explores the implications of developments in energy on the United 
Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including energy access, air quality 
and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; the implications for energy investments and finance; 
and the emerging role of India in the energy world.  


India has a major presence on the world stage. It is currently the world's second-most 
populous country after the People's Republic of China (hereafter, "China"), and is set to 
become the most populous in the 2020s. India has been one of the world's fastest-growing 
economies in recent years, and has become the fifth-largest in nominal terms, behind the 
United States, China, Japan and Germany. Expressed in terms of purchasing power parity 
(PPP), which adjusts for Indian buying power relative to other countries, India is the 
thirdlargest economy behind China and the United States. However, India continues to be a 
lowincome economy, with a PPP per capita income that is less than half of the world 
average. With half of India's population under the age of 25, India's economy has the 
potential to grow very rapidly.  
Since 2000, India has been responsible for more than 10% of the increase in global energy 
demand. On a per capita basis, energy demand in India has grown by more than 60% since 
2000, although there are widespread differences across different parts of the country as 
well as across socio-economic groups. On a range of economic and energy-related 
indicators, India has been catching up with the rest of the world in recent years (Figure 1.2). 
Coal demand per capita increased from 25% of the world average in 1990 to 60% in 2019 
and, mainly for this reason, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita increased from a little 
over 15% of the world average to a little under 40% over this period.  

There is huge potential for further growth in energy service demand in India due to an 
expanding economy and the forces of urbanisation and industrialisation. There are, 
however, critical questions about how demand growth will be met. With the notable 
exceptions of solar, coal and wind, India is generally resource-constrained. India is also very 
densely populated, with relatively high levels of water stress and land-use constraints, and 
structural poverty and other socio-economic factors mean that the affordability of energy is 
a major issue.  
India is characterised by the co-existence of shortage and abundance in several parts of its 
energy system. India possesses the world's fifth-largest coal reserves, but nonetheless is 
one of the world's major coal importers. India is a major centre for global oil refining, but 
relies overwhelmingly on imported crude. Many consumers face unreliable electricity 
supply, and there are significant commercial and technical losses at the distribution level, 
but in aggregate there is currently a surplus of generation capacity over demand. There is 
significant potential consumer demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), but this cannot 
always be met because of infrastructure bottlenecks and pricing constraints.  
The choice of per capita or absolute values for India makes a big difference in the way India 
looks in energy terms. The absolute values are large and growing, while per capita values 
remain low by international standards. Despite India being one of the world's largest 
energy users, Indians on average still consume significantly less than their counterparts 
elsewhere in the world, and much less than in advanced economies. India's annual CO2 
emissions are now the third-highest in the world, but barely make the top 100 as measured 
by emissions per capita, and are lower still if historical emissions per capita are considered. 


A lot has changed in India's energy sector since the last in-depth India Energy Outlook was 
published in 2015 (Box 1.1). While there has been progress on many fronts over these 
years, the extraordinary disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 has cast a 
cloud over the future. To avoid the spread of the virus, the Indian government put in place 
a series of lockdowns starting in late March 2020, with varying levels of stringency, with the 
latest estimates showing a contraction in GDP of about 8% in 2020 (IMF, 2021). There was 
inevitably a considerable impact on energy demand. Full-year estimates see India's primary 
energy demand falling 5% from 2019 levels, with coal and oil expected to take the largest 
hit due to far-reaching restrictions on mobility and a reduction in economic activity. Natural 
gas demand has been resilient, as low prices have offset some of the forces driving down 
demand. Renewables have also fared relatively well, with generation from wind and solar 
growing by 15%.  
The pandemic is not over, and its full implications are not yet visible. In the coming decade, 
India might see some durable, structural changes alongside temporary adjustments and 
breaks in trend. As we survey India's energy landscape, we explore how the outlook for 
various sectors might be affected by the shock caused by Covid-19. This new Outlook has 
been conducted during a period of extraordinary disruption, felt across all parts of Indian 
society. Its scenarios consider and incorporate the impact of this in different ways, including 
in the form of reduced GDP growth rates, reduced demand, a slightly lower turnover of 
capital stock, and a lower rate of investment across different parts of the energy sector.  

Covid-19 has caused a significant break in India's development trajectory; a key 
uncertainty is the extent to which changes lead to structural shifts or temporary disruption. 
 
What has changed since the 2015 India Energy Outlook? 

In the six years since the last India Energy Outlook was published, India's GDP has grown 
at an annual average rate of 6.7%. Among a range of economic reforms, one of 
particular importance was the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which 
has created a uniform tax code for most economic activity in India, with the notable 
exception of petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. 
Electricity access has been achieved much more quickly than projected in the 2015 
Outlook, reflecting a major additional policy push on this issue. Over the last decade, 
India has provided electricity to nearly 50 million new users every year, equal to the 
entire population of Spain. This is one of the most significant achievements in global 
energy in recent years. However, issues of reliability remain.  
Progress on renewables deployment has been immense since 2015, especially for solar: 
in 2019, India added nearly five times as much solar capacity as it did in 2015. A key 
driver of this has been the global decline in costs. The actual deployment of solar 
photovoltaic (PV) has been nearly identical to what was projected in the India Energy 
Outlook 2015 under the Indian Vision Case scenario, helped by ambitious policy targets 
and auctions.  
India has also made some significant progress on energy efficiency policy. The 
commercial building Energy Conservation Building Code was revised and strengthened 
in 2017, and Eco-Niwas Samhita, the energy conservation code for residential buildings, 
was launched in 2018. The existing industrial efficiency programme was expanded to 
include additional consumers and targets, and new appliances were added under the 
standards and labelling programme. Despite the growing deployment of renewables, air 
pollution has taken on much greater significance. India is home to some of the most 
polluted cities in the world. Visibly improved air quality from the nationwide lockdown 
in 2020 illustrated the impact of air pollution very clearly.  
Despite a new policy for hydrocarbons exploration and production, domestic production 
of natural gas has been lower than projected in 2015, while demand growth has been 
marginally higher. India is emerging as a bigger player in global gas markets, with the 
industry expecting India to absorb a large part of LNG supply growth. 
Globally, crude oil prices have fallen since 2015 and have remained at a much lower 
average level than before then. The previously high price levels had increased India's 
petrol and diesel subsidy burden, which has since been slashed to zero on the backs of 
subsidy reform and low crude prices. The focus of subsidies has now shifted to liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) to meet clean cooking access objectives.  
The share of coal in the energy mix has not really changed since 2015. The tremendous 
growth in renewables has tempered growth in coal capacity, but not prevented it. The 
rise in installed coal-fired capacity was in fact higher than that of solar and wind over 
the 2015-19 period (58 gigawatts [GW] coal thermal capacity installed versus 49 GW 
solar and wind), although renewables have outpaced coal-fired capacity additions since 
2017, and there have also been a number of cancellations in the pipeline of approved 
coal projects.  
Oil consumption has increased in lockstep with urbanisation and GDP growth. There are 
signs of growth in the use of alternative fuels for transport, but increasing levels of 
petrol and diesel vehicle ownership (and the growing popularity of sports utility vehicles 
[SUVs] in particular) means emissions trends continue upwards. There has also been 
some growth in urban light rail, although cities in general lack modern mass transit 
options. 
Electricity distribution companies continue to remain in poor financial health despite 
policies and reforms to address a range of issues. 
Mapping India's energy system  
India's energy needs are largely met by three fuels - coal, oil and biomass. These sources 
have, in aggregate, consistently met over 80% of India's total energy demand since 1990. 
Coal has strengthened its role as the dominant energy source, maintaining its strong 
position in power generation as well as being the fuel of choice for many industries 
(especially heavy industries such as iron and steel). Coal demand nearly tripled between 
2000 and 2019, accounting for half of primary energy demand growth. Today, coal meets 
44% of India's primary energy demand, up from 33% in 2000. Coal has played a significant 
role in India's economic development while also contributing to air pollution and growing 
GHG emissions. 
Traditional biomass - primarily fuelwood but also animal waste and charcoal - was the 
largest energy source in India in 2000 after coal, constituting about one-fourth of the 
primary energy mix. Overall energy demand has doubled since then, but the share of 
traditional biomass in the energy mix has been decreasing: it fell to 12% in 2019, largely as 
a result of efforts to improve access to modern cooking fuels, in particular LPG.  

Total primary energy demand in India 
 
India's energy demand has tripled over the last three decades: the share of traditional 
biomass has fallen, leaving coal and oil dominant. 
 
Note: Mtoe = million tonnes of oil equivalent. 
Oil demand has more than doubled since 2000 as a result of growing vehicle ownership and 
road transport use. LPG has also contributed to the growth of oil demand, in part because 
its use in cooking applications has been subsidised and promoted by the government. A lack 
of domestic resources means that India's dependence on imports of crude oil has been 
steadily rising, reaching around 75% in 2019. 
Among end-use sectors, India's industry sector has been the main source of energy demand 
growth since 2000, around half of which was met by coal. Transport energy demand grew 
3.5 times, while demand in buildings has grown by 40% since 2000, largely as a result of 
growing appliance ownership and increased access to modern cooking fuels. The declining 
share of agriculture in India's economic output, and the continued use of traditional 
farming methods, mean that the agriculture sector has seen the smallest amount of growth 
in energy use.  
Electricity consumption has nearly tripled over the past two decades - growing faster than 
total energy demand - as urbanisation and rising incomes push up the use of household 
appliances. Industry has also contributed to the increase in electricity demand through its 
increasing use of electrical motors and other machinery. On the supply side, coal remains 
the predominant force in the power sector, contributing over 70% of total generation in 
2019. Solar PV and wind accounted for 18% of the capacity mix in 2019, but their combined 
share of generation was less than 10%. 
 
Among end-use sectors, the growth in energy demand has been larger in industries than in 
transport and buildings, and this growth has largely been fuelled by coal.  

The traditional use of biomass dominates in states with lower per capita energy use; states 
with an energy-intensive industrial base account for the bulk of direct coal use. 
 
Note: toe = tonnes of oil equivalent.  
Within India, there is considerable variation in overall energy use across states, resulting 
from differences in economic and demographic trends, resource availability and industrial 
profiles. While India's total final energy consumption per capita is a third of the global 
average, a detailed review of the available state-by-state data shows that the range 
between the lowest-consuming and highest-consuming states varies by a factor of five 
(Figure 1.6 and Table 1.1). Average citizens in Delhi consume about half of the global 
average, while their counterparts in Bihar consume less than 20% of the global average. In 
states with lower per capita incomes, traditional fuels for cooking dominate. In states with 
higher per capita incomes, the share of electricity and oil products - which include 
transport fuel and also LPG - is higher, and it rises with increasing energy use.  


Electricity and modern life  
In 2019, India achieved a historic landmark of reaching near-universal household 
connectivity to electricity, meaning that over 900 million citizens have gained an electric 
connection to their households since 2000 - a remarkable achievement. There are still 
challenges in providing reliable, affordable and sustainable access to all potential 
consumers, but electricity consumption in buildings has nearly doubled over the past 
decade, outpacing electricity consumption in the wider economy. This has been driven by 
growing appliance use, even though electricity use in Indian households is largely limited to 
powering lightemitting diode (LED) bulbs, ceiling fans and televisions.  
Appliance use in Indian households differs starkly between urban and rural areas, with the 
exception of lighting and ceiling fans, which are very widely owned (Figure 1.7), and of 
televisions (TVs) and smartphones, which have ownership levels of over 60% in rural areas. 
Rural areas have relatively low adoption rates of other energy-consuming appliances, with 
fewer than one in five households owning a refrigerator, electric water heater or washing 
machine. Urban households are nearly four times as likely as rural households to own a 
refrigerator, seven times as likely to own a washing machine, and nearly nine times as likely 
to own an air-conditioning unit (AC) (Agarwal, et al., 2020). 

 
Most Indian homes own lighting, ceiling fans and TVs, while the ownership of other 
appliances is concentrated in urban areas. 
 
Note: Efficient appliances are those with 4 or 5 stars on India's standards and labelling programme, except 
for lighting where it refers to LEDs. 
India has seen a strong emphasis in recent years on the deployment of energy-efficient 
appliances, a policy push that has led to considerable energy savings. With the exception of 
three Indian states, LEDs are now used in over 80% of households thanks to a major effort 
to move away from more inefficient bulbs. The government's flagship Unnat Jyoti by 
Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, launched in 2015, has led to the deployment of 366 
million LEDs (Ministry of Power, 2020), while the LED Street Lighting National Programme 
has led to the installation of over 10 million LED smart streetlights by the Energy Efficiency 
Services Limited, a government-owned energy services company. The government 
estimates that energy savings of about 54 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year have been 
achieved through these measures (PIB, 2020).  
India's standards and labelling programme is meanwhile influencing consumer choices and 
the deployment of efficient appliances. This programme, introduced in 2006, is operated 
and managed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. As of 2020, over one-third of TVs, 
refrigerators and air conditioners and over one-quarter of washing machines and water 
heaters in use were classed as efficient, with 4 or 5 stars on India's standards and labelling 
programme.  
While the number of air conditioners in India is still low, sales are expected to grow sharply 
in the coming years. In anticipation, the government launched the India Cooling Action Plan 
in 2019. This aims to reduce cooling energy demand through a range of energy efficiency 
measures targeted at appliances and at building design and construction, while 
acknowledging the principle of "thermal comfort for all". 
Access to clean cooking  
Having electrified nearly every household in the country, one of the next big energy sector 
challenges for India is to achieve a full transition to clean cooking. Some 660 million Indians 
remain without access  to modern, clean cooking fuels or technologies. Access to clean 
cooking goes beyond technical availability: it also extends to issues of adequacy, reliability, 
convenience, safety and affordability.  
While the government has broadened availability to LPG through different schemes to 
reach most Indian dwellings, nearly half of all households in 2019 continued to rely on 
traditional uses of biomass for cooking, mostly in rural areas. The premature deaths of 
around 800 000 Indians every year are attributable to household air pollution, much of 
which is caused by the traditional use of biomass for cooking (Health Effects Institute, 
2020). The damaging health effects are felt disproportionately by women and children, and 
the time and effort involved in collecting biomass impose an additional cost that is again 
overwhelmingly borne by women.  
Affordability is the key factor that has made biomass hard to dislodge as a cooking fuel. In 
rural India, biomass and other traditional fuels are practically free or are available at a very 
low cost, compared with a significantly more expensive cylinder of LPG. To overcome this 
affordability barrier, the government has put in place two subsidy schemes to increase the 
uptake and regular use of LPG in rural areas: Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and 
Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh (PAHAL). As a result of the push towards clean cooking over the 
past decade, more than 200 000 premature deaths are estimated to have been prevented 
between 2010 and 2019 (Health Effects Institute, 2020).  
The PMUY scheme provides LPG connections to households living below the poverty line. It 
was originally launched in 2016 with the objective of providing 50 million LPG connections 
by 2019. This target was later increased to 80 million connections by 2020, and was 
achieved 
ahead of schedule. Under the PMUY scheme, the beneficiaries have access to an 
interestfree loan facility for the cost of stove and first refill. 
Once a household has an LPG connection, it continues to receive a subsidy through the 
Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG scheme, also known as PAHAL. Every residential consumer in 
India is eligible for this subsidy. PAHAL was launched in stages in 2013 and was scaled up to 
a nationwide scheme in 2015. Under PAHAL, a customer purchases an LPG cylinder at 
market price, and the subsidy is subsequently transferred to their bank account. In parallel, 
the government launched the "Give It Up" campaign to persuade high-income households 
to opt out, which led to at least 10 million households forgoing this subsidy.  
 
India connected almost half a billion people to the electricity grid during the last decade; 
attaining universal access to clean cooking is the next big challenge. 
 
Despite these schemes, household surveys reveal continued reliance on biomass for 
cooking, due in part to the burden of upfront payments. Even with the LPG subsidy, 
biomass is abundantly available at no or very little monetary cost for a significant number 
of households, particularly in rural India. Households may also choose to use biomass 
alongside LPG depending on their cooking preferences. This practice of using multiple fuels 
for similar purposes as the household income level increases is known as fuel stacking. 
Survey data indicate that fuel stacking appears to be common among users of the PMUY, 
who often procure LPG well below their allocations (CAG, 2019). Barriers to access, 
including the long distances sometimes involved in LPG supply, further contribute to 
continued reliance on biomass. 
Additional measures to promote LPG uptake such as the provision of cheaper 5 kilogramme 
(kg) cylinders (compared with standard cylinders that weigh 14.2 kg) have so far not been 
very successful. These cylinders accounted for only 0.2% of the cylinders sold by the end of 
2019, and significant increases in sales are likely to require active promotion and awareness 
building. The Covid-19 crisis added another dimension to the access challenge, with reverse 
flows of migrant labour back to rural areas and unemployment further reducing the 
affordability of LPG cylinders. To address this, the government announced that it will 
arrange for the distribution of three free full-sized cylinders to all 80 million PMUY 
beneficiaries.  
The total cost to the government of subsidising LPG depends on oil prices and rates of 
uptake. In 2019, it amounted to 23 000 crore Indian rupees (INR) ($3 billion).  
Alongside the increasing use of LPG in rural areas, there has also been growth in the use of 
pipeline natural gas (PNG) in urban areas. In April 2019, there were 5 million domestic PNG 
connections, over 90% of which were concentrated in four Indian states. The government 
now has plans to expand this city gas distribution network to cover 70% of all households 
by 2030. There is also potential for an accelerated uptake of induction and other electric 
cooking appliances, especially in urban areas, even though they accounted for less than 1% 
of cooking energy demand in 2019.  
Employment  
India has a large and diverse workforce employed in activities that can be broadly grouped 
into three sectors: industry, including manufacturing; services, including transport, utilities, 
information technology and retail; and agriculture. The share of the labour force in the 
agricultural sector has declined from about 70% in 1990 to less than about 40% today 
(meaning that the headcount of workers in agriculture declined by around 58 million even 
as India's overall labour force increased by over 110 million). There has been a 
corresponding rise in labour demand from the industry and services sectors, in which 
employment has more than doubled in the past three decades (MoSPI, 2019). This has gone 
hand in hand with growing urbanisation, with the share of the urban population increasing 
from 26% in 1990 to 34% in 2019, and many cities experiencing rapid growth.  
The resulting construction activity has led to rising demand for steel, cement, aluminium, 
plastics and chemicals. India has also emerged as a manufacturing hub for vehicles, 
electronics and pharmaceuticals. The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme has set 
energy saving targets for each industrial subsector and enables the trading of energy 
efficiency certificates, and this has helped to improve technical efficiencies. As energy 
demand from industry has tripled over the past three decades, its share in final 
consumption has risen to 36% today, higher than industry's nearly 30% share of GDP. The 
services sector's share of final consumption is also higher than its share of GDP: it accounts 
for 54% of GDP and 59% of energy use. By contrast, agriculture makes up 17% of GDP but 
only 5% of final energy consumption.  
 
The sectoral composition of employment and GDP has shifted away from agriculture over 
recent decades, but agriculture remains a big source of employment in rural areas. 
 
India has long pursued a structural economic shift towards manufacturing, and the 
government announced the landmark Make in India initiative in 2014 with the intention of 
turning India into a global manufacturing hub. This programme had a stated goal of raising 
the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25% by 2022 and creating 100 million jobs. However, 
despite reform measures attracting some foreign direct investment, the total number of 
manufacturing jobs - around 65 million - has remained broadly static since 2014, and the 
share of GDP attributable to manufacturing has remained around 17%. The sector has seen 
an annual average growth rate of 7%, outpacing agriculture but growing more slowly than 
the services sector (RBI, 2020). A higher share of industries in GDP and the material 
intensity of future economic growth would have profound implications on the outlook for 
the energy sector.  
Mobility and transport  
With a growing economy, Indians are now travelling farther than ever before. On average, 
Indians travel nearly 5 000 kilometres (km) each year, a threefold increase since 2000.  
Vehicle ownership per capita has grown five-fold since 2000, with particularly significant 
growth in the fleet of two- and three-wheelers (Figure 1.10). Today, with a stock of just 
over 200 million, there are five times more of these vehicles than passenger cars. Three-
wheelers in India are widely used in shared mobility and public transport, complementing a 
relatively low stock of 2 million buses that serve mass and public transport needs. Freight 
activity also quadrupled between 2000 and 2019, alongside a fivefold increase in the stock 
of light commercial vehicles, and a thirteen-fold increase in the stock of heavy freight 
trucks.  
The rapid growth of mobility has been enabled by the expanding road network in India, 
which increased from 3.3 million km in 2000 to 5.9 million km in 2016 (MoRTH, 2019). 
India's total road network is now the second-largest in the world, behind the United States.  
Indians are also travelling on rail twice the distance they did in 2000. India's per capita 
distance travelled on rail increased from 430 km in 2000 to nearly 860 km in 2019 (Figure 
1.11). With over 8 billion trips annually, rail continues to be one of India's most preferred 
ways to travel (Ministry of Railways, 2019). Freight activity similarly more than doubled on 
India's vast railway network, reaching 740 billion tonne kilometres (tkm) in 2018, although 
the share of freight that moves on railways has been falling.  
 
Two- and three-wheelers dominate India's road transport fleet, but account for a relatively 
small proportion of total energy demand in the transport sector. 
 
While air travel remains out of reach for most Indians, there has been a steady growth in 
India's aviation industry over the past decade. The per capita distance flown in India was 
110 km in 2019, which is three times as much as 10 years ago. Domestic passenger 
numbers, too, have nearly tripled in the last decade to over 140 million, up from around 50 
million in 2010 (DGCA, 2019). There has been an increase in short-distance flights in recent 
years, enabled by policies that have supported the development of small airports and made 
flying more affordable. India has added 50 domestic airports in the past five years, taking 
the total to about 150 airports with commercial operations. 
As Indians travel more and transport freight in larger volumes, the transport sector has 
become the fastest-growing energy end-use sector in the country. Energy use in India's 
transport sector has increased fivefold over the past three decades, reaching more than 
100 Mtoe in 2019. While other sectors are fuelled by relatively diverse sources of energy, 
transport is heavily reliant on oil, with 95% of demand being met by petroleum products. 
Just under half of India's oil demand is accounted for by transport.  
The Covid-19-related lockdowns and economic recession had a significant impact on 
transport demand in 2020. Overall road transport activity fell by 12% compared with 2019. 
While energy demand fell across all transport modes, it was most pronounced in domestic 
aviation and rail, falling about 20% in both these sectors. In time, however, the trends that 
have led to growing demand for transport are set to return, together with a range of 
challenges arising from this growth. Key among these challenges are road congestion, urban 
air pollution and growing dependence on imported oil. In India, about 75 000 vehicles of all 
types are sold daily, and there are now at least 42 cities and towns in India that have over a 
million vehicles each (MORTH, 2019). This large stock of vehicles has in turn contributed to 
an air quality crisis in urban areas.  
Indians have been travelling farther every year, resulting in growing energy demand from 
transport. 
 
India has responded to these challenges by instituting a range of policies to improve fuel 
quality and energy efficiency and to diversify the energy use of the sector. In April 2017, 
India put in place corporate average fuel consumption (CAFE) fuel efficiency norms for 
passenger cars, and these will become more stringent from 2022. The government 
mandated the leapfrogging of vehicle fuel standards from Bharat Stage-IV to Bharat Stage-
VI for all new vehicles sold starting April 2020. This standard is in line with Euro-6. The 
Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme was launched in 2003 with an ambition to blend 
an average of 5% ethanol into petrol, but it eventually fell short of this target owing to 
supply chain and procurement difficulties and a lack of attractive pricing. A more 
comprehensive National Policy on Biofuels (NBP) was approved in 2018 that envisages a 
target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030 
(MoPNG, 2018).  
India's push for compressed natural gas (CNG) in transport over the past decade has 
resulted in the doubling of CNG use in transport since 2010. There are now over 3 million 
CNG-fuelled vehicles registered in the country, 92% of which are concentrated in four 
Indian states. These vehicles are largely three-wheelers, buses and cars, most of which are 
used for shared mobility, for example as taxis, or for public transport.  
While India has a range of policies that support the increased adoption of a wide variety of 
electric vehicles (EVs) (section 2.3.2), electrification in road transport so far has largely 
come from two-and three-wheelers. The number of electrified two-and three-wheelers has 
grown by more than 60% each year on average since 2015, and there were 1.8 million such 
vehicles in 2019. Despite this rapid rise, they still constituted only 3% of overall two-and 
threewheeler sales that year. The electrification of transport has accelerated in other 
modes of transport too. India's railway network now has a target of 100% electrification of 
its tracks by 2022, up from 51% of the railway network (in route kilometres) in 2019. There 
has also been a rapid increase in urban light rail in cities. In 2020, over 650 km of metro rail 
was operational in 18 cities (MOHUA, 2020).  

Key issues for energy production and trade Coal 

Coal remains the bedrock of India's energy economy, commanding a 44% share of the 
primary energy mix, the third-highest among Group of 20 (G20) countries. India is the 
world's second-largest coal market, with plentiful domestic reserves. Indian mines produce 
over 700 million tonnes (Mt) of coal per year, mostly in the eastern part of the country in 
Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. The vast majority of production 
comes from open pit mining. Since the 1970s, government-owned Coal India Limited (CIL) 
has been the dominant coal producer and today it is the world's largest coal mining 
company, supplying over 80% of the country's domestically produced coal.  
Since the 1990s, the government has also made provision for "captive mining", which 
enables end users to mine their own coal, as CIL could not keep up with growing coal 
demand. At the outset it simply allocated captive mining rights, but since 2015 it has 
auctioned them through a competitive bidding process. However, this has not translated 
into meaningful growth in production from captive mining. To encourage further private 
investment, the government permitted commercial mining of coal in March 2020 and 
opened the sector to foreign investment.  
India has the world's fifth-largest proven coal reserves, but domestic production has been 
unable to keep pace with demand. This has resulted in a steady rise in imports in recent 
years (Figure 1.12), although the growth of import dependence on thermal coal has slowed 
since the mid-2010s as a result of increased domestic production and lower demand 
growth. Part of the import requirement arises from the steel industry's need for coking 
coal, which is far less abundant domestically than thermal coal. In addition, around 18 GW 
of coal-fired power plants (8% of the total fleet) are located in coastal areas and are 
designed to use imported coal rather than lower-quality domestic grades. Domestically 
produced coal also has high ash content and a low calorific value, raising operational, 
transport and maintenance costs. Despite these challenges, the government has a target to 
eliminate imports by 2025 by encouraging domestic coal production.  
The supply of coal is regulated by the government to ensure that coal reaches priority 
sectors while keeping transport and logistics costs down. Most domestically mined coal in 
the east ends up having to travel considerable distances by rail to reach consumption 
centres in the north and west. As a result, coal uses up almost half of all railway capacity for 
bulk commodity transport, and freight costs make up a considerable amount of the 
delivered cost of coal, particularly as they are used to cross-subsidise passenger rail fares.  
Coal is largely supplied at prices notified in fuel supply agreements (FSAs) by public-sector 
companies. These prices are set at a level intended to maintain average profitability across 
supplier companies rather than being dynamically linked to production costs or market 
forces. Notified coal prices are lower for "priority" customers such as power plants. 
Additionally, there are e-auctions where flexible quantities of coal can be supplied at a 
premium price, although only a small proportion of coal is traded this way. Coal mining also 
attracts a lower GST rate than other mining, but on the other hand it is subject to an added 
coal levy of INR 400/tonne (about $5.5/tonne) which acts as a de facto green tax. When this 
levy was first introduced in 2010, the revenues collected were directed to a National Clean 
Energy and Environment Fund (NCEEF). Upon the introduction of the GST in 2017, however, 
the original levy (the "coal cess") and NCEEF were abolished and replaced with a GST 
Compensation Cess on coal to make up for the shortfall in overall tax revenues.  
 
India's domestic production of fossil fuels has not been able to keep pace with demand, 
leading to a rapid rise in import dependence over the past two decades. 
 
Unlike coal, India has limited domestic resources of oil, largely relying on imported crude to 
meet its needs. India has become the second-largest net oil importer after China. Crude oil 
is brought in by tanker from the Middle East, Latin America and Africa to Indian refineries 
along the western coast. India's dependence on imported crude oil has been rising, and 
currently stands at around 75%. 
To address the risks that could arise from growing import dependence, the government has 
expanded its strategic petroleum reserve (SPR). As of mid-2020, India held around 40 
million barrels of oil in its SPR, equivalent to about 10 days of the country's net oil imports. 
India has a long-standing ambition to reduce oil import dependence, and the government 
announced in 2015 an ambition to reduce this dependence by 10 percentage points by 
2022. This was to be achieved through a variety of policies, including policies to expand the 
use of alternative transport fuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel and CNG, and through the 
expansion of domestic oil production. To encourage domestic exploration and production, 
the government adopted the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 
to provide a level playing field for the exploration of all types of hydrocarbons under a 
revenue sharing model.  
These policies have not so far succeeded in reducing India's oil import dependence, which 
has continued to rise, broadly tracking the increase in demand, while domestic oil 
production has remained broadly flat since 2015, as it has for the past three decades. Over 
these decades, however, India has proactively expanded its refining capacity, making it a 
net exporter of refined products. India's refining capacity stands at 250 Mt per year, making 
it the fourth-largest in the world. While production is largely in the hands of publicly owned 
companies, India's largest refineries are privately owned, notably the Reliance-owned 
Jamnagar refinery on the western coast of Gujarat, which is the world's largest. 
The prices of transport fuels, gasoline and diesel are determined by fuel retailers based on 
prevailing market conditions. The government has removed regulated prices and subsidies, 
and has progressively increased excise duties on these fuels during periods of lower crude 
oil prices.  
Natural gas 
While the share of natural gas in India's primary energy mix has largely remained flat in 
recent years at around 6%, overall energy demand has risen rapidly, and there have been 
significant shifts in demand for natural gas in specific sectors of the economy. The use of 
natural gas as a fuel in industry has increased about tenfold since 2010, against the 
background of an overall 50% increase in energy use in the sector. This has increased the 
share of natural gas in industry from less than 2% to nearly 10%. Similarly, natural gas use in 
buildings has tripled over the past decade, albeit from a low base. These increases have, 
however, been partly offset by a fall in the use of natural gas for power generation. The 
pressures that have led to this fall remain: nearly 60% India's natural gas-based power 
generation capacity is facing extreme financial pressure and operating on very low 
capacities on account of lack of affordable gas.  
India has a stated ambition to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix to 
15% by 2030, up from 6% in 2019. The government has been taking a range of measures in 
support of this ambition in order to expand domestic production, facilitate imports and 
encourage demand. To expand production, HELP allows for pricing and marketing freedom 
for gas produced from deepwater, ultra-deepwater and other complex reservoirs. The gas 
price from all other fields is determined on a half-yearly basis by a formula linked to hub 
prices in other countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the 
Russian Federation. In 2020 the government also launched the Indian Gas Exchange (IGX), a 
trading platform for natural gas. The relatively low level of gas prices over the past few 
years has, however, acted as a disincentive for significant investments in domestic 
production.  
Growth in India's gas demand has outpaced domestic production, leading to rising 
dependence on imported LNG. Imports of natural gas have risen from 20% of India's total 
gas demand in 2010 to 50% today. To facilitate these imports, India has six LNG terminals. 
Although there are some infrastructure bottlenecks, India already has a 17 000 km network 
of pipelines to transport gas to centres of consumption, and it has ambitions to expand this 
grid significantly. India's downstream regulator, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory 
Board, is in charge of overseeing this expansion as well as of regulating tariffs for users of 
this infrastructure. In addition to this long-distance pipeline network, India has ambitious 
plans for city gas distribution (CGD) networks to cater to households, commercial 
establishments and factories within cities. There are currently 18 states with CGD networks, 
and successive bid rounds have awarded CGD licences with the aim of reaching 70% of all 
households by 2030.  
Solar and wind 
The most remarkable story in India's power sector in recent years has been the growth of 
solar PV and wind, which have rapidly increased their share of the overall energy mix in 
recent years as coal and hydropower capacity growth has slowed (Figure 1.13). Over the 
past five years, solar PV capacity has grown at an average growth rate of around 60% and 
wind capacity of around 10%, outpacing the 7% growth in overall installed capacity. This 
rapid growth reflects government policy support and falling equipment costs.  
In 2015, the Indian government announced a target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022 
(excluding large hydro), which included 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind capacity. 
Published a year after India had set these aggressive targets, the 2015 India Energy Outlook 
projected that India's solar capacity would reach 28 GW in 2020 under the prevailing policy 
framework in the New Policies Scenario (the forerunner of today's Stated Policies Scenario 
[STEPS]), but that it could reach 48 GW under a more aggressive Indian Vision Case. The 
Outlook identified several challenges that would need to be overcome to scale up 
renewables in India, including difficulties in acquiring land, the financial difficulties faced by 
distribution companies, and the long-term nature of existing contracts with conventional 
producers. Partly owing to the effective management of these risks, India's solar capacity 
reached 38 GW by 2019 (mostly utility scale), with wind adding a further 38 GW of capacity. 
Together, they now constitute nearly 20% of India's installed capacity. In 2019, India 
announced a new target of 450 GW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030. 
 
With coal capacity growth slowing down and solar PV and wind ramping up, the share of 
variable renewables in installed capacity has doubled since 2014. 
 
The policy actions that have facilitated the growth of grid-connected renewables include 
reverse auctions resulting in progressively falling prices, lower corporate tax rates for 
developers, renewable purchase obligations mandating utilities to procure a certain 
minimum purchase of renewable power (in 2019-20, the guideline set by the central 
government was 17.5%, although state regulators have their own targets), investment in 
transmission infrastructure, and support for solar parks that help reduce project 
development and land acquisition risks.  
The rise of renewables in India's power sector has been a major success story; wind and 
solar PV now account for 7% of total generation, twice their share in 2014. In renewable-
rich Indian states, wind and solar contribute as much as 15% of power generation. In some 
states, they contribute nearly 50% of power generation during those parts of the year when 
wind speeds are at their strongest. Solar PV and wind have been relatively resilient during 
the crisis in 2020; even though overall electricity demand was down sharply in the second 
quarter, coal accounted for most of the reductions in generation. 
However, there are still important structural, regulatory and institutional challenges that 
could hamper further growth, and progress has been uneven across different renewable 
technologies. The challenges include the poor financial position of many state distribution 
companies, difficulties in obtaining access to finance and in acquiring land, grid congestion, 
and uncertainties over grid infrastructure development. The expansion of rooftop solar has 
lagged behind the growth in utility-scale projects, constrained by higher costs and the lack 
of attractive financial models for consumers. Rooftop solar had a share of 40 GW in the 100 
GW solar target for 2022, but deployment remains at well under 10 GW. This sector is now 
a focus area for the government as 2022 gets closer.  Similarly, despite an identified 
potential of 10 GW to 20 GW, offshore wind has not yet taken off in India owing to the high 
cost of capital and to supply chain and infrastructure bottlenecks.  
Other technologies and fuels 
Growth in the share of wind and solar PV in the Indian power system needs to be 
accompanied by a strengthening of grid infrastructure. To address this, the government has 
been focusing on flexibility in operations, technologies and infrastructure. The Green 
Energy Corridors initiative is one attempt to boost flexibility; it aims to expand and improve 
transmission infrastructure, facilitate the integration of renewable energy management 
centres and energy storage options, and enhance the flexibility offered by India's thermal 
power fleet.  
Storage technologies are also set to be vital to India's electricity security. Of the country's 
4.8 GW of installed pumped storage hydro capacity, 3.3 GW is operational; total pumped 
storage hydro potential has been estimated at 90 GW (CEA, 2019). Battery storage will also 
have an important part to play. The government estimates that India will require 27 GW of 
grid-connected battery storage by 2030 (CEA, 2019), and has established a National Mission 
on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage in 2019 with the aim of becoming a 
competitive battery manufacturer. In May 2020, the government also announced the result 
of the first ever "round the clock" renewable energy auction, which will lead to the 
development of 400 MW of generation capacity that will supply power through the day 
through a combination of solar and other generation and storage technologies. India also 
announced in November 2020 a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the domestic 
production of high-efficiency solar PV modules and advanced chemistry cell storage 
batteries.  
India has significant potential to expand its modern bioenergy sector, which can be done 
using the vast quantities of organic waste generated by the agricultural sector as well as a 
growing amount of municipal solid waste, used cooking oil and wastewater. There are a 
number of supporting policies, some of which have been strengthened in recent years, 
notably new biofuel blending targets and plans to expand India's bio-compressed natural 
gas infrastructure.  
India has also made initial steps towards exploring the potential of hydrogen as a source of 
energy. The first roadmap for the fuel was produced in 2006 by the Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energy, and the government has since been investing in research and 
development via various public sector institutions.  
1.3 	Energy and India's development path 
India's energy choices are inextricably linked to wider socio-economic developmental goals. 
The use of energy, development of energy markets and deployment of technologies are not 
ends in themselves, but means for the country to reach wider objectives including 
economic growth and improvements in the quality of life and the environment. This section 
explores the linkages between the energy sector and wider economic, social and 
environmental issues.  
1.3.1 	Energy and the economy 
The year 1991 was a seminal one in India's economic history. India took important steps in 
that year to liberalise its economy, initiating a change towards a more market- and 
servicesbased economy. This altered the trajectory of its development, expanding per 
capita incomes, attracting higher levels of private and foreign investment, stimulating 
competition, and leading to new manufacturing capacity, new service-sector firms, 
productivity gains and a falling poverty rate. Along with greater economic activity came 
increasing competition for land resources and growing levels of emissions and pollutants, 
presenting new challenges for society at large.  
In the period between 1991 and 2019, India's GDP grew at an annual average rate of 6.8%, 
outpacing the average annual growth of 4.2% in the two decades before that. India was one 
of the world's fastest-growing large economies in this period, second only to China (Figure 
1.14). With GDP having nearly doubled over the past 10 years, India has become the 
world's third-largest economy in PPP terms and the fifth-largest in nominal terms.  
India's per capita annual income has quadrupled since 1991 and reached $8 100 (PPP) in 
2019. Although this remains well below the world average of $18 500 (PPP), the rapid rise 
in per capita incomes has led to a significant fall in India's poverty rate. India's Poverty 
Headcount Ratio  fell from 48% in 1993 to 13% in 2015 (World Bank, 2020). This has been 
accompanied by a rise in standards of living and development indicators. India's Human 
Development Index value has increased from 0.43 in 1990 to 0.65 in 2018, representing a 
growth in life expectancy, education access and incomes (UNDP, 2019).  
Growth in the economy has fuelled the demand for energy, and the growing supply of 
energy has fuelled India's economic growth. Indians on an average now use nearly twice as 
much energy as they did three decades ago, as a result of rising vehicle ownership, demand 
for construction material and a rise in appliance ownership. However, India's energy 
intensity of GDP has improved at an average rate of 3% per year during these three 
decades, meaning it has required less energy over time to produce an additional unit of 
economic output. This has happened as a result of the growth in the Indian services sector, 
energy efficiency improvements and a transition away from inefficient biomass towards 
modern fuels.  
 

The Covid-19 pandemic has given India an abrupt economic shock, with April-June quarterly 
GDP falling by 23.9% and an estimated contraction of about 8% for the whole of 2020. This 
contraction, which has had a significant impact on energy demand across fuels and sectors, 
was caused by the disruption of the global economy due to the pandemic, and by the 
lockdown measures taken by India to address the spread of the virus. To counter its impact 
on the economy, the Indian government in May 2020 announced an economic recovery 
package with the overarching theme of Atmanirbhar Bharat ("Self-Reliant India"). This 
included welfare transfers to farmers, free LPG cylinders for the least well off, concessional 
loans for the medium and small industrial sector, the injection of liquidity into power 
distribution companies, and tax changes. The government also included measures to 
promote manufacturing in India and government procurement from domestic companies.  
India's economy had been witnessing a slowdown even prior to the pandemic. Its 
annualised economic growth had fallen to 4.7% in the final quarter of 2019, the lowest in 
five years. Other economic indicators such as growth of private consumption, capital 
investments, exports and industrial activity also indicated a slowdown. In particular, capital 
investments, exports and the Index of Industrial Production registered negative growth in 
the second half of 2019. The year also saw a decline in vehicle sales and a slowdown in the 
growth of steel consumption and in sales of fast-moving consumer goods. The government 
had already introduced measures in 2018 aimed at simplifying and streamlining aspects of 
economic life, such as the GST. The post-pandemic recovery will not only have to address 
the disruption caused by Covid-19 but also to build on these measures and tackle structural 
obstacles to economic growth that existed prior to the crisis.  
Investment and finance  
Over the past decade, investment across the whole of India's economy has surged, with 
gross fixed capital formation doubling to $770 billion in 2019 from 2010 levels. Most of this 
has come from domestic sources: foreign direct investment inflows amounted to $50 billion 
in 2019. Public finances have also improved considerably in recent years. The fiscal deficit 
has stayed slightly above 3% (as a share of GDP) and the government debt-to-GDP ratio has 
declined since the early 2000s. In addition, foreign reserves held by the Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) have increased by 1.5 times since the early 2010s, and tenfold since the early 
2000s, providing an additional buffer during periods of financial stress.  
Key economy-wide investment indicators weakened in 2020 due to the crisis. Rising debt 
and equity market risk premiums have more than offset a reduction in base lending rates by 
the RBI, increasing the economy-wide cost of capital by around 30 basis points, while bank 
credit growth across all sectors has stalled. Faced with economic uncertainty and strained 
balance sheets, corporations responded by reducing investments. In September, new non-
financial capital projects declined to their lowest level since 2007, while the number of 
projects outstanding dipped to a four-year low. Fiscal pressures have pushed down central 
government capital expenditures by 12% through September for fiscal year 2020-21 
compared to the same period in 2019-20. In the energy sector, we estimate that 
investment is set to decline by almost 15% to around $70 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 
following five years of stable spending at around $80 billion, with larger falls in grid 
networks 
Investment in renewables exceeded fossil fuel power investment for the fifth year in a row 
in 2020, while investment in networks has been falling recently in absolute and relative 
terms. 
 
Notes: Efficiency and other end use investment estimates are not available prior to 2014. Other end use 
includes carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in industry, spending to meet the incremental cost of 
EVs, and investment in private EV charging infrastructure. 
India's energy investment trends vary across different parts of its energy economy, 
reflecting differences in market conditions, policies, capital allocation and costs. Investment 
in oil and gas supply was hit hard by lower demand, prices and revenues in 2020, and fell by 
20% to $12 billion compared to 2019. In recent years, reforms brought about through the 
HELP programme, putting all hydrocarbons under a single exploration and production 
policy, have underpinned stronger spending.  
Coal supply investment reached an average of around $10 billion in 2017-19, although it is 
estimated to have fallen by nearly 15% in 2020. Ongoing reforms aim at increasing 
investment, in particular through the opening of the coal sector to commercial mining by 
domestic and international companies. However, challenges remain, including the pressure 
from international investors, which restricts financing options.  
The power sector accounts for over half of energy investment in India. Capital investment 
amounted to almost $50 billion in 2019, a 4% decline from 2018, and a further drop of over 
15% is expected in 2020. Investments in renewable power surpassed those in coal power 
plants for the fifth year in a row in 2020. Spending on coal power has moderated in recent 
years, though it remains above $10 billion a year, with up to 60 GW of coal-fired capacity 
designated as being under construction. However, a stark decline in final investment 
decisions for new plants since 2016, as well as more constrained bank lending, points to 
much lower investment levels in the years ahead.  
Recent momentum in the power sector has been driven by investment in renewables, 
which grew by 60% over 2015-19 to $18 billion. Utility-scale solar PV and wind have led this 
growth, underpinned by supportive policies, competitive auctions, improved economics 
and a maturing industry. Although investment in these technologies is set to decline in 
2020, interest has remained high, and the capacity awarded through auctions between 
January and June 2020 rose for the third consecutive year. The pandemic has nevertheless 
added uncertainty over India's ability to attract a diverse pool of private finance to meet 
ambitious deployment targets in the years ahead (see Chapter 4). Moreover, progress in 
other technologies such as distributed solar PV and bioenergy remains slow, with new 
financing challenges emerging. New hydropower investments have also been slow to 
materialise, although recently announced measures could help facilitate fresh investment. 
These include the creation of a hydro purchase obligation (HPO) to encourage hydropower 
purchases, and budgetary support for flood control and hydro energy storage projects.  
The financial and operational performance of state distribution companies - key developers 
of grids, purchasers of power and integrators of new technologies - continues to constrain 
capital availability, despite efforts such as the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) 
initiative. This initiative involved writing off debt and restructuring loans against a 
commitment to improve performance. However, investors and developers continue to be 
concerned about the risks involved in power purchase projects. An $18 billion backlog of 
payments to generators emerged in 2020, and further reforms are required to enable 
distribution companies to return to profitability, including measures to achieve 
costreflective pricing. 
Investment in grids has trended downwards in recent years from more than half of power 
investment in 2015 to around one-third in 2020, reflecting the challenging financial 
situation of distribution companies, while spending on battery storage is at an early stage 
and remains low. The government is, however, working to expand inter- and intra-state 
transmission capacity, which is key to the successful integration of a rising share of 
renewables. The first Green Energy Corridor project - a 1 800 km high-voltage transmission 
line - began construction in 2017, with the aim of transporting power from resource-rich 
states to other states more effectively than at present; the project will cost more than $5 
billion (Ministry of Power, 2020). The government is also looking at new ways to procure 
flexible resources, for example by integrating batteries in utility-scale renewable tenders.  
Spending on energy efficiency, electric mobility and the direct use of renewables accounts 
for just over 10% of energy investment. Over 40% of efficiency investment has occurred in 
industrial sectors, supported by the PAT scheme, while investment in more efficient 
appliances and buildings accounts for another quarter. Sales of EVs and EV charging 
installations are low, but are set to grow rapidly. Investment in solar thermal heaters has 
expanded rapidly to nearly $1 billion in 2019, supported by government grants and rising 
interest among industrial users. 
1.3.2 	Energy and society 
Growth in average per capita income and a fall in poverty means that increasing numbers of 
Indians are able to afford private modes of transport, clean cooking technologies, modern 
appliances and larger homes. However, income growth has been characterised by various 
kinds of inequities that are reflected in energy consumption levels, in particular in terms of 
interstate variances, poverty, the rural-urban divide, gender and caste. The provision of 
access to energy and opportunities to use it needs dedicated interventions that focus on 
gender, caste and class (Patnaik & Jha, 2020). 
The 12 wealthiest states in India, including Goa, Haryana, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil 
Nadu, have an average per capita income that is at least twice as high as the bottom 8 
states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. With an urban 
population of 44%, the wealthiest states are also twice as urbanised as the lower-income 
ones. These two groups of states have similar population sizes. 
In terms of energy, the total final consumption of these higher income states is 40% higher 
than those with low per capita incomes. This trend holds true on a per capita energy use 
basis too (Figure 1.16). There are a few notable outliers, including Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh 
and Odisha, which combine relatively low per capita incomes with high energy use owing to 
the size of energy-intensive industries such as steel and cement in those states. Nearly 40% 
of Indians reside in states with both low per capita incomes and low per capita energy use.  
Figure 1.16 ? Population size, GDP per capita and energy use per capita by state 
and union territories in India, 2018 
 
There is considerable variation in energy consumption across the states of India. The 
biggest coal-producing states challenge the normal relationship between economic 
output and energy use. 
 
Notes: UP = Uttar Pradesh, AP = Andhra Pradesh, MP = Madhya Pradesh, HP = Himachal Pradesh. Delhi is 
shown separately from the remaining union territories, as the capital of India. 
The state-by-state differences are overlaid by a pervasive rural-urban divide in energy use, 
as well as by major gender differences (see Spotlight). The rural-urban divide is linked to a 
range of factors, including income and appliance ownership levels, which feed through into 
electricity consumption (Figure 1.17). In 2014, the bottom 60% of households in rural India 
consumed less than 50 kWh of electricity per month, compared with an average of 100 
kWh in urban areas. This rural-urban divide extends to access to clean cooking and the 
materials used in the construction of houses. In 1990, only 30% of rural homes were built 
using modern building materials, compared with 75% of homes in urban areas; the rest 
were built using traditional materials such as unburnt mud, cow dung and other organic 
materials. This gap in terms of housing is narrowing, however: by 2018, 79% of rural and 
97% of urban houses were being constructed using modern materials.  
Another dimension to inequity that is unique to India is the caste system. Historically, 
marginalised caste groups categorised as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have had 
less access to electricity and clean cooking after controlling for factors such as income and 
education. These groups make up about 16% of India's population (Saxena & Bhattacharya, 
2017). 



A long way to go: Women's participation in India's energy sector 
The issue of women's access to and participation in the energy sector is a key aspect of 
inequity in India. Economic progress in recent decades has not been matched by 
progress towards women's equal economic participation. The World Economic Forum's 
Global Gender Gap Index 2020 ranks India 112th out of 153 countries in offering equal 
opportunities to women and men, and women often lack the same access to health 
care and education as their male counterparts.  
Between 1990 and 2019, the female participation rate in the workforce fell from 30% to 
15% while the male participation rate remained largely constant at around 55%. India's 
declining female labour force participation has been particularly pronounced in rural 
India, with rural women leaving India's workforce at a faster rate than urban women 
(WEF, 2020). This low and falling participation rate among women has significant 
impacts on energy inequity in several ways: it leads to low workforce participation in 
the energy sector, lower demand for appliances, lower access to safe mobility, and 
lower clean cooking access and affordability.  
Globally, women hold only around 22% of jobs in the energy sector as a whole, and 32% 
in renewables  (IRENA, 2019). In India, the percentage of women with jobs in the energy 
sector is even lower, at less than 10%, and many of these jobs are non-technical (IEA-
CEEW, 2019). In the rooftop solar sector, women account for an estimated 11% of the 
workforce.  
India's low labour force participation rate for women is due in part to the gender wage 
gap, a lack of safety policies and flexible work arrangements, and cultural norms 
regarding women's work. Indian women are often required by their families to prioritise 
domestic work. A social stigma continues against women working outside the house, 
especially for those who can afford not to work. These trends risk being further 
aggravated by Covid-19, as the sectors most impacted by the pandemic are those with 
higher shares of female labour participation. 
Poor access to safe and affordable transport for women imposes further constraints on 
their access to health care, education, and other social facilities and services, thereby 
effectively limiting their opportunities to participate in the country's workforce to the 
same extent as their male counterparts. Globally, it is estimated that safety concerns 
and limited access to transport reduce the probability of women participating in the 
labour market by 16.5%  (ILO, 2018). Understanding and responding to women's 
mobility needs, which are different from those of men, is essential to enable more 
equitable participation in the energy sector and economy more widely. 
Energy transitions can have important implications for gender gaps and equality in 
employment and remuneration. India has a high share of female graduates in 
engineering, and the renewable energy sector tends to attract a relatively high 
proportion of women. Accelerating the deployment of renewables could therefore 
mean an acceleration of employment in this sector for women. Codifying policies to 
provide a safe place for women to work, including accommodation, sanitation facilities 
and transport, would help to make this happen. Equal opportunities also implies 
protection from discrimination and access to maternity and parental leave allowances. 
Achieving universal access to clean cooking options would also provide an important 
improvement in health for women together with major time savings and increased 
employment opportunities. Women are disproportionately exposed to household air 
pollution from the burning of traditional biomass, leading to a higher prevalence of 
asthma, pulmonary diseases and lung cancer among households that use biomass for 
cooking (Kankaria, Nongkynrih and Gupta, 2014). Women in these households also 
spend significant amounts of time collecting fuel. The PMUY scheme issues LPG 
connections specifically to women in poor households, and in some states women play 
a key decisionmaking role in processes that aim to accelerate the transition away from 
the traditional use of biomass.  
Reliability and affordability  
Reliability and affordability are key concerns for Indian consumers, and they are closely 
intertwined. Affordability is also a key consideration for clean cooking fuels (see section 
1.2.1). 
Satisfaction with electricity services is highly correlated with the hours of electricity that 
households enjoy (Alkin et al., 2016). Urban households receive about 22 hours of 
electricity a day on average, and rural households receive about 20 hours. Lack of reliability 
is an important issue. In rural areas 53% of households experience multiple power cuts in a 
day compared with 30% of their urban counterparts.  
Unreliable power is a major barrier to economic and social development, and imposes 
additional financial burdens on consumers, not least in terms of the expense of maintaining 
backup sources of power (Box 1.2). The use of such backups is widespread. In 2017, even as 
electricity access was improving, many rural households continued to use kerosene for 
lighting (Jain, 2018). In urban areas, diesel generators are common, especially in modern 
high-rises, while individual households often have rechargeable batteries to help them cope 
with power cuts. Similarly, about 35% of rural enterprises appear to be dependent on non-
grid electricity sources such as solar home systems, rechargeable batteries, mini-grids, and 
diesel generators. These additional sources of power or lighting increase the financial 
burden on already low- and middle-income households (Smart Power India and ISEP, 2019).  
Affordability is a key component of energy access, and tariffs for the Indian residential 
sector are much higher in PPP terms than in other developing countries (see Chapter 3). 
These relatively high tariffs, coupled with low per capita incomes, mean that energy costs 
account for a significant share of household expenditure. To address this issue of 
affordability, state governments have been cross-subsidising consumers by providing 
inexpensive electricity to households with low consumption. Electricity tariffs also tend to 
be fixed, and are often below cost price, leading to financial losses in distribution 
companies which in turn lead to frequent bailouts. The state governments in charge of such 
bailouts often struggle to make timely and complete payments, and this has prompted the 
central government to step in with loans and policy reforms (see Chapter 4.3).  
Figure 1.18 ? Share of electrified households affected by power outages, 2019  
 
In addition to subsidised prices, distribution companies suffer from high aggregate technical 
and commercial losses, and from difficulties in billing and revenue collection. Their 
consequent financial difficulties lead to a vicious circle of under-investment in 
infrastructure and poor quality of service (Figure 1.18). In line with its objective to provide 
reliable and continuous power, the government is deploying a range of policies to address 
these linked reliability and affordability barriers, while encouraging efforts by the utilities to 
improve the efficiency of their billing and revenue collection and to reduce aggregate 
technical and commercial losses.  
One important government initiative is to replace 250 million analogue meters with smart 
meters across India over the next three years to improve metering and consumption 
transparency, and avoid the errors and costs that come with manual billing. Energy 
Efficiency 
Services Limited, a government-owned energy services company, has already installed 1 
million smart meters in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar and New Delhi 
(Economic Times, 2020). In 2020, the government also announced that it was considering a 
new tariff policy penalising unscheduled power cuts to incentivise investment in power 
infrastructure.  
Box 1.2 ? 	Electricity security and the role of captive power 
Captive power plants provide a localised source of power to an energy user. They play a 
crucial role in India's electricity generation, accounting for 75 GW of installed capacity 
and around 15% of total generation in 2018 (Figure 1.19). This is higher than the global 
average of around 7% and much higher than the advanced economies average of 4%. 
These facilities serve a wide variety of consumers from households and small businesses 
to large industrial plants, but the motivation is the same in all cases: to provide a hedge 
against unreliable supply from the grid, and - especially for large consumers - to benefit 
at times from cheaper power than that supplied by the grid.  
As in the broader electricity mix, coal is the most common fuel source for captive plants, 
accounting for nearly 90% of captive generation (the bubble size in Figure 1.19 
represents captive generation). Natural gas, with 10% of total captive generation, is the 
secondlargest fuel source and is mainly used by petrochemical and fertiliser industries, 
which also use gas as feedstock for their production processes. The cost-effectiveness of 
these captive plants is helped by the structure of electricity tariffs, under which 
industrial and commercial users effectively cross-subsidise residential and agricultural 
customers (the price of grid electricity for industry is on average 70% higher than for 
residential users). Many of these industrial captive units are relatively old assets that 
have been fully depreciated. 
The true extent of diesel generator use across India is unclear, as official data only 
include units of more than 1 MW; studies based on manufacturer data indicate that 
total capacity may be as much as 90 GW (The Indian Express, 2014). The many smaller 
units implied by 
this data are relatively expensive to operate and are also a source of local pollution, even 
if used only sparingly.  
Captive power as a share of total generation and capacity by fuel, and total captive generation by fuel, 2018 
most all diesel-based generation in India takes the form of captive power for small 
businesses and households; coal-fired plants play a significant role for large industries. 
  
 

Rooftop solar is another potential source of captive power that is being increasingly 
taken up by both residential and commercial users, although adoption has fallen short 
of official targets. As rooftop solar schemes gain momentum and the cost of integrated 
solar-plus-battery offers falls further (and as government schemes make it easier for 
people to sell excess power back to grid), small-scale renewables are likely to go a long 
way towards replacing diesel backup. As gas networks expand within cities, gas-based 
generation could also become viable for larger users.  

Energy and the environment  
Air quality 
Air pollution has emerged as one of India's gravest environmental problems in recent years, 
and energy use is at the heart of it. In 2019, there were well over one million premature 
deaths related to ambient and household air pollution; only China has a higher toll of 
premature deaths. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and National Green Tribunal 
has identified 124 cities across 24 of India's 36 states and union territories as "non-
attainment cities" for exceeding pollutant levels set under the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 2009 (CEA, 2019). Although already a substantial number, the 
total of 124 cities may be an underestimate because not all of India's nearly 500 cities have 
air quality monitoring stations.  
 
Nearly half of India's population lives in regions with fewer than 200 clean air days a year.

While air pollution in India is perennial and affects all parts of the country, northern states 
suffer with particular acuteness in winter, and this contributes to making northern India 
one of the world's most polluted regions (Figure 1.20). The high levels of air pollution in 
northern India in the winter have much to do with the region's geographical and 
meteorological conditions, but the source of this pollution is anthropogenic, and stems 
primarily from the use of energy. From 70 to 90% of the particulate matter emissions in 
India's five largest urban agglomerations are a result of energy use (Figure 1.21).  
Sectoral origin of PM2.5 emissions in selected urban agglomerations  
 
Notes: NCR = National Capital Region. Industrial emissions includes power generation; data for Bangalore 
and Chennai are from 2015, while the data of Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi NCR are from 2018; the NCR 
includes the cities of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Faridabad and other districts that are a part of the 
geographic entity of NCR; all urban agglomerations considered include some non-urban areas that are a part 
of the surrounding areas. 

The contribution of human activity to air quality was illustrated during India's Covid-19 
related lockdowns, which brought a halt to almost all economic activity. During the six-
week lockdown that started in late March, PM2.5 levels were 58% lower in Delhi, 45% lower 
in Bangalore and 30% lower in Chennai than in the same period in the previous year. Similar 
steep drops were observed in various Indian cities and for all key air pollutants including 
sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and carbon monoxide (Navinya, Patidar, & Phuleria, 2020). 
These improvements were short-lived, however, and air quality deteriorated quickly as 
restrictions linked to the pandemic were eased. 
The sources of pollutants vary depending on the region and time of the year. The largest 
contributors across regions tend to be transport, industry, power generation, and biomass 
or waste burning. One key trigger of rapidly deteriorating air quality in northern India every 
year is agricultural residue burning in October and November, although transport, industry 
and other energy sector sources continue to account for a large share of emissions even at 
this time of the year.  
While the focus of research, monitoring and action has largely been on urban areas, air 
quality levels are also very poor in rural India, where ambient air pollution is compounded 
by poor household air quality due to the traditional use of biomass for cooking. The overall 
result is that air pollution has emerged as one of India's deadliest killers and therefore a 
major public health issue.  
The Government of India responded by launching the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) 
in 2019, with a target to reduce PM2.5 and coarse particulate matter (PM10) concentrations 
by 20-30% by 2024 from 2017 levels. While such a reduction will not necessarily ensure that 
cities meet the standards under NAAQS, this is the first time that an air quality 
improvement target has been linked to a specific date for delivery.  
Meeting the target by the date set in the NCAP is likely to be challenging, not least because 
it will depend on changes in sectors that are not within the remit of the Ministry of 
Environment, Forests and Climate Change, which is the ministry with responsibility for the 
NCAP. The changes required are likely to need to include electrification and modal shifts in 
transport, the universal adoption of clean cooking fuels, a more consistent and stable 
supply of electricity along with higher levels of renewables generation, and action on 
industrial emissions through greater energy efficiency and the use of alternative sources of 
energy to reduce pollution. In northern India, where agricultural residue burning is a key 
contributor to air pollution in the winter, there is an opportunity to expand the use of 
agricultural residues in the (currently small-scale) production of bio-based fuels and 
electricity.  
Land  
Historically, the primary land challenges relating to energy in India arose from hydropower 
projects. Despite much of this hydropower capacity being added many years ago, a number 
of difficult legacy issues remain, including the resettlement and rehabilitation of 
populations that were displaced during the construction of dams. More recently, India's 
push for utilityscale solar has also thrown up challenges around land procurement and use. 
The National Institute of Solar Energy has estimated that 750 GW of solar PV would need 
only 3% of India's wasteland areas (TERI, 2017). However, wasteland areas have declined 
over the past few decades, and such wasteland may not always be ideally located for solar 
projects. In those cases where agricultural land is to be procured for solar projects, the 
approval of such land for non-agricultural uses can be a time-consuming and contentious 
process. Land is a statelevel responsibility in India, meaning that approvals are needed from 
the relevant departments of state governments, and from village-level administrations. 
Improperly maintained land records can lead to patches of land being claimed by multiple 
entities, and this can slow down land acquisition or lead to litigation.  
There are other obstacles too. In some states, there are land ceiling limits which restrict the 
amount of land that individual owners can acquire. The high population density in most 
parts of the country, and the tendency of land holdings to be fragmented, compound the 
difficulties. The average farmland holding was 1 hectare in 2015 (Business Standard, 2018). 
With the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) stating a minimum land requirement of 
1.5 hectares per megawatt, this implies that developers have to deal with multiple 
landowners. 
Measures have been introduced to overcome these problems and facilitate the acquisition 
of land for the development of solar capacity. The SECI has been developing solar parks 
with state governments, and in these cases the issue of land acquisition is handled by the 
government. Single-window clearances have also been set up in a few states to expedite 
approvals. Nonetheless, the lack of a transparent and uniform land acquisition policy, 
combined with the multiplicity of approvals required, means that land acquisition continues 
to be a problematic issue for many developers.  
Carbon dioxide emissions 
Per capita emissions in India remain low by international standards, but 14% of global 
energy-sector emissions growth since 1990 has nonetheless come from India. India's 
energysector related CO2 emissions have more than quadrupled since 1990, with the major 
sources of emissions growth being power generation, industry and transport. 
Emissions growth from power generation over this period has been nearly twice total 
emissions from all sectors in 1990. Coal meets 45% of India's primary energy demand, but is 
responsible for 70% of India's energy sector CO2 emissions. The carbon intensity of India's 
power sector is 725 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (g CO2/kWh), compared with a 
global average of 510 g CO2/kWh, underlining the predominant role of inefficient coal-fired 
generation (Figure 1.22). 

 
 
India's per capita CO2 emissions are 60% lower than the global average, but the emissions 
intensity of its electricity generation is among the highest of any country.  
 
Notes: tCO2 = tonnes of carbon dioxide; C&S America = Central and South America. 
After power generation, the next highest emitting sector is industry (Figure 1.23). India 
provides just over 6% of steel production globally, and the iron and steel sector is the 
largest industrial subsector in terms of emissions: it is responsible for around 30% of India's 
industrial energy consumption. Coal provides around 85% of the energy used for iron and 
steel, and the sector makes relatively little use of recycled scrap. This means that India's 
steel industry is more emissions-intensive than its counterparts in many other countries.  
India provides around 8% of global cement production, and this is the second-largest 
emitting industrial subsector. Although coal and oil are the main fuels used to provide heat 
for its cement industry, a number of energy efficiency measures have been introduced at 
Indian cement plants, and total emissions (including indirect emissions from the use of 
electricity) per tonne of production are nearly 15% lower in India than in China. 
Figure 1.23 ? CO2 emissions from the Indian energy sector, 2019 
 
Mt CO2
India's power sector is the largest contributor to its CO2 emissions, and coal-fired power 
plants are responsible for the great majority of power sector emissions.  
 
Note: Other includes other energy sector and agriculture 
Oil demand for road freight transport in India has tripled since 2000, highest after China. 
More than 45% of emissions from road transport in India come from trucks. India's 
heavyfreight trucks have a relatively high level of fuel consumption per tonne kilometre 
compared with other countries, but the implementation of new engine standards in 2020 
should help to reduce the emissions intensity of activity in the future. 
Emissions from passenger road transport in India have also quadrupled since 2000. India 
has a high share of two- and three-wheelers in its vehicle fleet (four-fold of passenger cars), 
and this helps to explain why passenger cars in India accounts for only 18% of its overall 
transport emissions (merely 36% even if two- and three-wheelers is added). This is much 
lower than many other countries; in the United States, for example, passenger cars account 
for 57% of total transport emissions. 
The direct use of fossil fuels in the buildings sector resulted in just over 160 Mt of CO2 
emissions in 2019, with a further 460 Mt of indirect emissions coming from the use of 
electricity. India has been seeking to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings through 
mandatory building energy codes and voluntary rating schemes, as well as through 
programmes to improve the efficiency of appliances and equipment.  
Water  
With just 4% of the world's water resources but 18% of its population, India counts as one 
of the world's most water-stressed countries. Around 45% of its population faces acute 
water shortages. Groundwater, which provides 85% of the country's rural drinking water 
and about 60% of its irrigation water, is being rapidly depleted (Kim, 2018). A third of 
India's groundwater reserves are currently overexploited, meaning more is pumped out 
than is naturally recharged by rainfall. Moreover, almost 70% of India's water is 
contaminated (NITI Aayog, 2018). India also suffers frequently from natural disasters: 
between 1996 and 2015, 19 million people a year in India were impacted by flooding and 
17.5 million people a year were affected by drought (UN Water, 2019).  
Agriculture accounts for 80% of India's water demand. Water-intensive rice, sugar, maize 
and cotton are the most prevalent crops grown, and their export means that India is 
effectively the world's biggest water exporter. Agriculture in India is significantly dependent 
on irrigation, with over 30% of its agriculture relying on it. A legal framework allowing 
farmers to extract as much water as they want from underneath their land has contributed 
to the rapid decline of India's groundwater resources. To improve agricultural productivity 
and boost incomes, India has undertaken an aggressive campaign to deploy almost 3 million 
solar pumps. Up to 2018, roughly 180 000 had been deployed. This initiative does not, 
however, help to tackle the problem of declining groundwater resources, and may 
exacerbate it. 
The problems have been made worse by inefficient irrigation practices, such as flood 
irrigation. On average, targeted irrigation is deployed on just 10% of irrigated areas across 
states. The upshot is that water use efficiency on farms in India is among the lowest in the 
world: three to five times more water is used than on farms in China or the United States to 
produce the same amount of crops (NITI Aayog, 2018). Switching from low- to high-
watersaving irrigation practices could save up to 47% of irrigation water by 2030 (Vaibhav, 
2020).  
Today, the energy sector withdraws roughly 30 bcm of water (the volume of water removed 
from a source) and consumes almost 6 bcm (the amount withdrawn but not returned to a 
source) (Figure 1.24). Coal-fired power generation accounts for 80% of the water 
withdrawals made by the energy sector, with the water being used mainly for cooling and 
ash disposal. The energy sector accounts for less than 5% of India's total water withdrawals 
and less than 2% of consumption, but water availability is nonetheless essential for India's 
energy security.  
India's thermal power plants are already being impacted by water stress: droughts and 
water shortages caused India to lose 14 TWh of thermal power generation in 2016 (Luo, 
Krishnan, & Sen, 2018). Recognising the risks posed by potential future water shortages, the 
government introduced a requirement for new and existing thermal power plants to switch 
to cooling towers (which withdraw less water than once-through systems) and to comply 
with water consumption limits per megawatt-hour. Compliance is self-reported, however, 
and a recent study found that only half of thermal plants for which data could be obtained 
were compliant with the rules (Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, 2019).  
Figure 1.24 ? Water use in India's energy sector by fuel and power generation 
type, 2019  
 
Coal-fired power generation accounts for 80% of India's energy sector water withdrawals. 
 
India has made significant progress towards providing access to clean drinking water and 
sanitation for all (UN SDG 6). Over 90% of the population now has access to a basic water 
service.  However, more work remains to be done: nearly 200 000 Indians die each year 
from a lack of access to safe drinking water, 60% of India's wastewater is released 
untreated, and 40% of the water supply is lost to leaks or theft  (Kim, 2018; NITI Aayog, 
2018), while 40% of India's population does not have an improved drinking water source 
available. 
For those who do not have access to water, its collection is often done by women, who 
obtain it from tankers in urban areas or by walking on average 5 km to 20 km a day to a 
source of water in rural areas (Chandran, 2018). For those who do have access to water, the 
quality can be poor and intermittent. In many cities, supply is available for just two to three 
hours a day on average (Chattopadhyay, S., 2020). The government has pledged to provide 
access to safe and adequate drinking water to all by 2022 and a piped water connection to 
each household by 2024 via the Jal Jeevan Mission.  
Increasing water demand, declining per capita water availability, problems with water 
quality, lack of storage options, and changing patterns of use all mean that water will 
remain a challenge for India in the years to come. On current trends, it is estimated that 
half of India's water demand will be unmet by 2030 (NITI Aayog, 2018). The government of 
India established the Ministry of Jal Shakti in May 2019, which seeks to prioritise water 
needs and co-ordinate policies and actions affecting water and water-related activities. 
Given the importance of water for its energy future, it will be necessary to assess the 
existing and potential future water needs of the energy sector in order to avoid potential 
choke points and to identify synergies where they exist. 
Several synergies emerge when the SDGs are viewed through an integrated lens, especially 
between SDG 6 (water and sanitation for all) and SDG 7 (energy for all). For example, 
technologies being deployed to provide access to electricity can also help with the provision 
of clean drinking water through the use of pumps and filtration systems. Approaching water 
and electricity access in an integrated way may shift the emphasis from off-grid solutions 
towards mini-grid or grid-connected solutions, especially if productive uses are considered, 
for example the use of water and electricity in agriculture. Managing the energy-water-food 
nexus is going to be essential in the effort to reach development and climate goals. 
1.4 	Which way from here? 
The projections in this Outlook, described in detail in the chapters that follow, describe 
possible pathways for the future of Indian and global energy systems. They largely follow 
the overall scenario structure in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020, but there is also an 
additional case that is specific to this report. The main variable that differentiates the 
various pathways is the way that government policy preferences and implementation 
evolve over the coming decades, but our analysis also allows us to explore the implications 
of a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, as well as a pathway in which a prolonged 
pandemic has longer-lasting effects on India's economic development. 
?	The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) assumes that significant risks to public health are 
brought under control gradually over the course of 2021, allowing for a steady 
recovery in economic activity. This scenario incorporates our assessment of all the 
policy ambitions and targets that have been legislated for or announced by the Indian 
government and by other governments around the world. These include nationally 
determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. An overview of the policy 
aims incorporated into the STEPS is included in the next section. It is important to note, 
especially in the light of the IVC, that broad energy and environmental policy objectives 
are not automatically assumed to be met in the STEPS. They are implemented to the 
extent that, in our assessment, they are backed up by specific measures and funding. 
This is not a judgement of the feasibility of the government's ambitions or its 
commitment to them, but a reflection of our view of the real-life constraints - 
including regulatory, financial and administrative barriers - that have to be faced. 
?	The India Vision Case (IVC) takes a more optimistic view of the prospects for full 
implementation of India's stated policy aims (Box 1.3). On the economic front, the IVC 
implies not just a rapid resolution to the public health crisis caused by Covid-19, but 
also successful structural reforms that raise the long-term growth potential of India's 
economy, meaning that the assumed rate of economic growth is higher than in the 
STEPS. In the energy sector, it assumes that key targets are met to the extent possible. 
One important finding from this analysis is that it is not possible to hit every target; for 
instance, the government's volumetric target to expand domestic coal production is 
not met in the IVC partly because of the expansion of renewables and improvements in 
efficiency in line with other government targets. The IVC in this year's edition follows a 
similar case included in the 2015 India Energy Outlook, allowing us to explore how 
India's vision has evolved over the last five years. 
?	By contrast, the Delayed Recovery Scenario (DRS) examines downside risks to 
economic and social development, linked to the possibility that the Covid-19 pandemic 
turns out to be more prolonged than assumed in other scenarios. The overarching 
policy assumptions are similar to those in the STEPS, but the assumed rate of economic 
growth is lower. The global outcomes in this scenario are explored in full in World 
Energy Outlook 2020; insights into the implications for India are introduced at various 
points in the chapters that follow. 
?	The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) takes a different approach from the 
other scenarios and cases in this Outlook. Whereas the others take a set of initial 
assumptions and see where they lead, the SDS works back from the achievement of 
specific outcomes and assesses what combination of actions would be required to get 
there. The key outcomes that this scenario delivers are drawn from the UN SDGs: 
effective action to combat climate change by holding the rise in global average 
temperature to "well below 2°C ... and pursuing efforts to limit [it] to 1.5°C", as set out 
in the Paris Agreement; universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy 
services by 2030; and a substantial reduction in air pollution. In the SDS, India is on 
track to reach net zero emissions beyond the modelling horizon - in the mid-2060s.  
None of these scenarios is a forecast of what will happen over the coming years; the IEA 
does not have a single view of how the future will look. With myriad near-term 
uncertainties, our aim is more modest and, we hope, more useful: to highlight the range of 
possible futures, and the actions and circumstances that might bring them about. 
The projections in each of these scenarios are generated by the IEA World Energy Model, an 
energy systems model that has been developed over many years to provide insights into 
energy and environmental trends. A key asset of this integrated modelling is that it allows 
us to investigate the interconnections among different parts of the system, both within 
India and between India and the rest of the energy world. This generates insights into the 
trade-offs and co-benefits that exist between different policy objectives and courses of 
action.  
India faces the need to pursue multiple policy objectives in parallel in order to support a 
growing population and economy, including energy access, energy security and 
sustainability. In order to do so effectively, there is a need to approach energy policy 
making and planning with a view to the system-wide impacts of different policy choices. For 
example, road or rail transport policies formulated by the respective ministries in India have 
potential implications not only for transport demand, but also for power generation 
capacity, refinery configurations, natural gas supply infrastructure, GHG emissions and air 
quality. And India's choices also have significant impacts for global trends. The scenarios 
and analysis in this Outlook allow us to highlight these interlinkages. 
How is the India Vision Case different? 
The IVC reflects the energy, environment and economic targets of the Indian 
government. It goes beyond stated policies and tests the following aspirations against 
the outcomes of WEO modelling:  
Achievement of 450 GW of non-hydro renewable capacity by 2030. A greater 
degree of financial de-risking, underpinned by a favourable regulatory 
environment, allows public and private actors to scale up investment in clean 
energy technologies. Compared with the STEPS, there is much greater uptake of 
rooftop solar and wind energy. 
A substantial increase in the share of natural gas in India's primary energy mix by 
2030. There is a much greater use of gas for electricity generation than in the 
STEPS, and gas is used in particular as a source of flexibility. Gas also displaces fuels 
including diesel in the captive power sector. 
An acceleration in the uptake of alternative fuels in the transport sector. The share 
of EVs in total road vehicle sales reaches 38% by 2030 (25% of sales in the case of 
passenger cars), and bioenergy, including both bioethanol/biodiesel as well as bio-
CNG, start to be used.  
A rapid and widespread implementation of efficiency measures across the energy 
economy, especially in buildings but also in industry.  
Achievement of India's energy access goals in full by 2030, meaning that traditional 
uses of biomass are entirely phased out by this date. 
A longer-term focus on deep decarbonisation of the industrial sector, which 
translates into a ramp-up of carbon capture and storage technologies, together 
with early efforts to explore hydrogen pathways that yield some initial production 
from low-carbon sources. 
1.4.1 	India's energy policies 
India's energy policies and ambitions are often disparate and sector-specific because they 
emanate from different ministries and agencies (Box 1.4). However, these policies and 
ambitions all relate to the overall goal of providing affordable, reliable and sustainable 
energy services.  
India's NDC under the Paris Agreement is an important reference point for energy and 
climate policy. In the NDC, India has committed to improve the emissions intensity of its 
economy by 33-35% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and to achieve a 40% share of 
non-fossil fuels in electricity generation capacity by 2030. The prime minister of India has 
also articulated seven focus areas for its energy economy, including a move towards a 
"gasbased economy", cleaner use of fossil fuels, greater use of biofuels, rapid scaling up of 
renewables, a focus on electric mobility, a shift towards emerging fuels including hydrogen, 
and digital innovation across energy systems. 
There are specific targets to be achieved by 2030, including 450 GW of renewable power 
capacity, a 15% share of natural gas in the primary energy mix, a 30% share of passenger 
car sales for EVs and a 20% blending of biofuels in petrol. There are also targets for 
increased energy efficiency across sectors, affordable housing for all, the electrification of 
railways, the reduction of crude oil imports, and the ending of coal imports in the 2020s. 
While they all come under the overarching framework described above, many of these 
targets were decided independently of one another.  
In addition to central government targets, there are subnational targets announced by state 
governments, especially in the case of electricity, EVs and energy efficiency. For instance, 
the state of Gujarat announced in 2019 that it will no longer invest in new coal-fired power 
capacity. Some states also have targets and policies on rooftop solar and electric mobility in 
their respective jurisdictions.  
Box 1.4 ? 	India's energy governance and institutional arrangements 
India's energy sector is subject to the central and state governments in different ways. 
Under India's constitution, the petroleum, natural gas, aviation and railways sectors 
come within the legislative ambit of the central government, whereas electricity comes 
within the legislative ambit of both the central and state governments. As a result, 
India's energy sector is governed by multiple ministries and agencies at both the central 
and state levels.  
In the central government, various ministries and agencies have energy-related 
responsibilities under the overall purview of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Each of 
these in turn has under it a range of specialist agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as 
public sector undertakings (PSUs), which are publicly owned companies (Figure 1.25). 
There are also agencies under the 28 state governments with responsibilities related to 
electricity, road transport, buildings and energy efficiency; these include State Electricity 
Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) in charge of managing intra-state transmission, 
distribution, trade and other aspects of electricity supply. There is also a Forum of 
Regulators (FOR) to facilitate co-ordination among the multiple state regulatory 
agencies and the central regulator.

1.4.2 	Economic and population growth  
Alongside energy policies, the other principal determinants of energy demand growth in our 
scenarios are the rates at which economic activity and population are assumed to grow. 
These indicators are naturally subject to a wide level of uncertainty, which has been 
exacerbated - particularly for the economy - by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. With 
this in mind, this India Energy Outlook considers multiple possible trajectories for future 
growth in India's GDP. 
After an unprecedented drop of around 8% in economic output in 2020, uncertainties over 
employment and strains to balance sheets and household finances are feeding through into 
constrained investment, despite government attempts to stimulate activity and limit the 
economic damage (see section 1.3.1). Against this backdrop, the near-term shape of the 
economic recovery is closely tied to success in tackling the spread of the virus. However, 
the longer-term outlook also depends on building out India's physical and social 
infrastructure (a major focus for India's stimulus spending), as well as on progress in 
tackling structural challenges affecting investment such as complicated permitting 
processes, tax arrangements and land acquisition processes.  
 
Note: Calculated based on GDP expressed in year-2019 US dollars in PPP terms.  

Our baseline assumption in the STEPS and in the SDS is that the pandemic is gradually 
brought under control in the course of 2021, allowing for a steady but far from V-shaped 
recovery in economic activity. In these scenarios, the supply side effects of the pandemic 
are significant, but are limited by the relatively short duration of the crisis together with 
effective policy responses, and the trend rate for growth in Indian GDP post-2022 moves 
back towards the level assumed before the crisis. The Indian economy is nonetheless 
smaller in 2040 than it was in the same scenarios in the WEO 2019. 
In the IVC, a swift and effective recovery from the effects of Covid-19 is accompanied by a 
range of structural reforms that allow India to recover the lost ground in full and raise its 
long-term growth potential. In this case, India becomes a $5 trillion economy before the 
end of the decade, somewhat later than targeted by the Indian government. Conversely, 
the DRS illustrates the risks arising from a prolonged pandemic. In this scenario, 
unemployment and fragile finances hit demand and investment across the entire economy, 
and rising debts limit the scope and effectiveness of government action.  
To put these growth trajectories in historical context, we looked at macroeconomic data 
since 1950 to see how other countries fared from the moment that they achieved a similar 
level of economic development to today's India, and compared the subsequent economic 
performance of those countries with the assumptions in our scenarios. Despite the shock of 
Covid-19, the assumed rates of growth in all our India scenarios are in the upper part of the 
historical range (Figure 1.26). The IVC is in the top 10% of the sample, and the only 
countries that have performed better than India does in the IVC are East Asian exporters 
such as Korea that saw sustained rates of rapid growth. In the STEPS and SDS, India's 
projected growth would come in slightly ahead of the post-1993 record of Thailand (a 
period that includes the effects of the Asian financial crisis). 
Figure 1.26 ? India's economic outlook by scenario in a historical context  
 
 
The GDP growth rate outlook considered in the IVC is in the top 10% of the sample of 
countries with similar levels of per capita income in the past.  
 
Notes: Figure shows the average change in GDP per capita over a 20-year period for a sample of countries, 
starting when GDP per capita was comparable to India today. Data since 1950, excludes major hydrocarbon 
exporters.  

Our population assumptions for India are derived from the median variant of the United 
Nations projections  (UNDESA, 2019). According to these estimates, India's population rises 
from 1.37 billion in 2019 to 1.59 billion in 2040, meaning that it becomes the most 
populous country in the world by the mid-2020s. India's total fertility rate in 2017 fell to 
2.2, implying that every woman was giving birth to 2.2 children. Since then it is likely to 
have fallen close to the "replacement level" mark of 2.1 - and will continue to fall in the 
next two decades - thereby moderating the population growth to 2040. The share of 
India's population living in urban areas is currently around 34%, but this is assumed to rise 
to 46% by 2040, meaning that India's urban population is projected to rise by some 270 
million people over the coming two decades. This is the equivalent of adding a new city the 
size of Los Angeles every year. 
1.4.3 	Energy prices  
The equilibrium prices for our scenarios (where comparable scenarios exist) have been 
revised down as a result of the pandemic, because of the effect of the crisis on global 
demand and because of changes to producer strategies and cost structures on the supply 
side. However, although the price trajectories are smooth, the possibility of price spikes and 
volatility cannot of course be discounted, and may indeed have increased as a result of very 
sharp cuts to investment and strains on producer finances. 
In the case of oil, prices rise in the STEPS in order to stimulate a rebound in investment, 
after which they settle in a range between $75/barrel to $85/barrel, a level at which global 
supply - including from US shale - is quite elastic. Natural gas prices rise gradually as the 
current global surplus erodes: India's imports are increasingly assumed to be priced off 
indices that reflect Indian market dynamics rather than the cost of competing fuels. 
International coal prices remain subdued, reflecting lower global consumption as well as 
the ambition in India to satisfy a larger share of demand from domestic supply. 

Natural gas prices are averages for imported gas, expressed on a gross calorific value 
basis. Steam coal prices are weighted averages adjusted to 6 000 kilocalories per kilogramme. The steam coal 
price is solely for imports. India prices for natural gas and steam coal are both wholesale prices. 
Prices in the IVC are assumed to be broadly similar to those in the STEPS, as the changes in 
Indian demand are not in themselves large enough to affect global equilibrium prices. 
Natural gas could have been an exception to this, but the upward pressure on global prices 
created by extra Indian LNG imports in this scenario is assumed to be offset by the creation 
of a deeper and better functioning gas market, which in itself is sufficient to bring forward 
additional investments in supply. 
Prices in the DRS are lower for each fuel than in the STEPS because demand is lower and it 
takes longer to work off the existing overhang in supply capacity. In the SDS, fuel prices 
stabilise at still lower levels because of considerably lower demand for fossil fuels, removing 
the need to develop higher-cost resources. 
1.4.4 	Technology innovation, deployment and costs 
A wide range of technologies are deployed to meet energy demand in our scenarios, and 
the cost of each of these is influenced in the World Energy Model by a continuous process 
of technology improvement and learning. This applies across the board to appliances and 
motors purchased by end users; infrastructure for transporting energy products, including 
smart grids; and technologies for electricity generation, energy extraction and 
transformation. 
A crucial dynamic for the India outlook is the way that key renewable electricity production 
and storage technologies - including solar PV, wind and batteries - are expected to 
continue getting cheaper quickly through a combination of research, economies of scale 
and improvements in manufacturing and installation processes (Figure 1.27). The pace of 
change varies by scenario according to levels of deployment, linked in turn to the policies 
that are in place. However, with revenue support mechanisms in place that bring down 
financing costs in countries including India, new solar PV projects are now estimated to 
have levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of $20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $40/MWh in 
India, entirely below the range of LCOE for new coal-fired power plants and approaching 
parity with the operating costs of some existing coal-fired plants. Coal-fired plants may be 
able to capture some additional market value because of their ability to match system 
needs, indicating a closer competition than one based solely on costs alone. But it remains 
the case that utility-scale solar PV is already very well placed as a preferred technology for 
new generation, and there are innovative ways in which solar is being bundled together 
with other technologies to increase its value (see section 3.2).  
 
Utility-scale solar PV is now consistently cheaper than new gas- or coal-fired power plants 
due to technology gains and revenue support mechanisms. 
 
Note: CCGT = combined-cycle gas turbine. 

Oil and gas costs around the world are structurally lower than in previous WEOs, although 
in many cases resources gradually become more expensive to extract over time (as 
continued upstream innovation and technology improvements are offset by the effects of 
depletion on costs). As a result, these fuels face increasingly stern competition in a growing 
number of applications from low-carbon energy supplies. 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced major new uncertainties into the outlook for 
India's energy sector, but it has not altered the key underlying drivers. Chief among 
them are urbanisation and industrialisation. Up until now, India's economic growth 
has been driven mainly by the services sector, rather than the more energy-
intensive industry sector, and the rate at which India has urbanised has been 
somewhat slower than in other emerging countries. How fast India urbanises and 
industrialises over the coming decades, and which policies govern these processes, 
will be of crucial significance for its energy future and for global trends.  
Over the period to 2040, an estimated 270 million people are likely to be added to 
India's urban population, the equivalent of adding a new city the size of Los Angeles 
every year. Even with such rapid urbanisation on a very large scale, the share of 
India's population living in urban areas in 2040 is still expected to be less than 50%. 
India leads global energy demand growth in every WEO scenario, although the way this 
demand is met depends on the interaction of policies, technologies and market forces. 
Most of the buildings that will exist in India in 2040 have yet to be built. Urbanisation 
underpins a massive increase in total residential floor space from less than 20 billion 
square metres today to more than 50 billion in two decades' time. This prompts 
huge growth in demand for energy-intensive building materials. In the STEPS, 
demand for cement more than doubles to 2040, and demand for steel nearly triples.  
Urbanisation is also a spur for a transition in household energy use away from solid 
biomass and towards electricity. Rising ownership of appliances and demand for air 
conditioners mean that the share of energy demand taken by electricity in India's 
buildings sector rises from a quarter today to around half by 2040 in the STEPS. 
There is considerable scope for India to expand the application of its Energy 
Conservation Building Codes and further tighten appliance standards to limit future 
strains on its energy system. 
Transport is currently the fastest-growing end-use sector in terms of energy demand, 
and urbanisation will foster further growth. In many Indian cities, increasing demand 
for transport has so far led to much congestion and poor air quality. This has 
prompted a range of policy initiatives on fuel efficiency and quality, mass transit, and 
the electrification of transport. However, today's policy settings are not yet enough 
to avoid a large projected increase in oil demand for road transport, which doubles 
in the STEPS by 2040. 
Industry is the end-use sector that currently uses most energy, and its share in total 
final consumption rises from 36% today to 41% by 2040 in the STEPS. As coal use for 
power generation flattens out, industry accounts for almost two-thirds of the growth 
in India's coal demand and becomes the major source of growth in emissions. 
Moreover, since the majority of goods transported in India move by road, industrial 
expansion translates into rapid growth in diesel use for road freight, despite 
initiatives to shift more of the freight market onto the railways. 
Efforts to promote energy efficiency and material efficiency, and greater use of 
natural gas and electricity, in particular for lighter manufacturing, all mitigate the rise 
in industrial energy use in the STEPS, but there is considerable potential for further 
efficiency gains. These gains are seen to some extent in the IVC and more 
comprehensively in the SDS.  
Different scenarios inevitably produce different outcomes. In the DRS, energy 
demand and emissions are suppressed by a lower level of economic activity. Positive 
environmental outcomes therefore come at a very high cost. By contrast, the IVC 
delivers both higher economic growth and lower emissions than the STEPS as a 
result of policy actions which increase efficiency and achieve a faster transition to 
clean electricity and natural gas.  
The SDS goes further in the direction of improving efficiency and the use of 
lowcarbon technologies. Alongside improved air quality and enhanced energy 
access, India sees an early peak in energy-related CO2 emissions and a rapid 
subsequent decline, putting the country on track for net zero emissions by the mid-
2060s. 
 	 


Overview of energy demand 
India, in common with much of the rest of the world, has been severely affected by the 
Covid19 pandemic, in terms of both the immediate toll on human life and the broader 
impact on livelihoods due to lockdowns and other restrictions. There are multiple possible 
pathways that India could follow as it emerges from today's crisis (Figure 2.2).  

 
Differences between scenarios to 2030 are explained by duration of the pandemic (in DRS) 
and a faster pace of structural changes in energy production and use (in IVC and SDS). 
 
Note: Pre-crisis shows the WEO 2019 STEPS projections. 
One key near-term uncertainty is the effectiveness of measures to limit the spread of the 
virus, including how quickly vaccines are made available and distributed. The DRS examines 
the effects of a prolonged pandemic and a slow economic recovery.  
Another key uncertainty is the policy response from the Indian government and others to 
today's challenges. This includes the extent to which they incorporate energy and 
sustainability into their recovery strategies, and the extent to which they address structural 
issues that characterised the economy even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Different 
assumptions about these policy responses underpin the differences in energy and 
economic outcomes between the STEPS, the IVC and the SDS. 
The electrification of the Indian energy economy continues apace in all scenarios. The 
share of electricity in total final consumption grows in all sectors, and particularly in the 
buildings sector, where there is a continued pivot away from traditional biomass and a 
steady uptake of appliances. In the STEPS, the share of demand met by electricity rises 
from around 17% today to nearly a quarter by 2040, displacing 60 Mtoe of oil, coal and 
biomass.  
The dominance of coal in India's energy system continues to recede. Coal is the 
slowestgrowing energy source in the STEPS, meaning its share in the energy mix falls from 
44% in 2019 to 34% by 2040. As the incumbent fuel in the power sector, coal faces strong 
competition from renewables in general and from solar PV in particular. However, greater 
electricity demand and a near-doubling in the use of coal in industry means that the overall 
demand for coal still rises by over 30% from 2019 to 2040, reaching 770 Mtce. 
Oil demand, by contrast, sees a relatively swift comeback from Covid-induced disruption. 
There is a doubling in oil demand in road transport by 2040 in the STEPS, largely as a result 
of the addition of 170 million passenger cars and 25 million trucks to the vehicle stock 
between 2019 and 2040. Oil consumption is also lifted by a tripling of feedstock demand in 
the petrochemical industry.  
Natural gas is the fastest-growing fossil fuel in the STEPS, and the roll-out of gas 
infrastructure makes the fuel accessible to a growing share of India's industrial base as well 
as to residential consumers. The share of industrial energy demand accounted for by gas 
doubles to reach 20% by 2040. Policy support for gas use in transport, both as conventional 
CNG and bio-CNG, results in a threefold increase in CNG demand.  
The energy mix in India becomes much more diverse. Today coal, oil and traditional 
biomass meet more than 80% of demand. In 2040 modern bioenergy and renewables 
including solar, wind and hydropower meet nearly a quarter of India's total energy demand 
in the STEPS. Primary energy use per unit of GDP falls by half as the link between economic 
growth and energy consumption weakens further. 
In the STEPS, total CO2 emissions in 2040 are 45% higher than in 2019, and emissions per 
capita also rise, but emissions intensity goes down significantly. India's NDC under the Paris 
Agreement include a reduction by 2030 in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35% 
compared with 2005 levels. The energy sector achieves this target under the STEPS, with a 
CO2 emissions intensity reduction of over 40% by 2030.  
In the IVC, key Indian policy objectives are met in full, and this delivers higher economic 
output together with lower energy demand and lower emissions than in the STEPS. India 
moves more quickly towards a gas- and renewables-based economy, and the use of 
traditional biomass in particular fades rapidly as modern cooking fuels gain ground.  
The SDS sees a far more profound transformation of India's energy sector. Demand in 2040 
is nearly 30% below the level in the STEPS, as the move away from traditional biomass is 
complemented by concerted efforts to improve energy efficiency across a wide range of 
end uses. There is a decisive shift away from coal, and solar PV eclipses coal's share of 
electricity generation a full decade ahead of the STEPS. Oil demand reaches a plateau by 
the end of the 2020s as the share of alternative fuels in road transport - electricity, gas and 
bioenergy - rises: together these alternative fuels meet 35% of road transport demand by 
2040. Fossil fuels account for less than 60% of primary energy demand by 2040, compared 
with 72% in the STEPS, while the traditional use of biomass falls to zero by 2030, as clean 
cooking goals are fully achieved. In the SDS, India sees an early peak in energy-related CO2 
emissions and a rapid subsequent decline, putting the country on track for net zero 
emissions by the mid-
2060s. 
The diagrams in Figure 2.3 provide a visual representation of the flows of energy in India's 
energy system, and show how they change from 2019 to 2040 in the different scenarios. 
The diagrams include the various transformation processes used for electricity and for fuels 
(e.g. refining), and also illustrate the substantial conversion losses that occur in the process 
of electricity generation. These losses are dramatically reduced in the SDS because of the 
shift towards non-combustion renewable sources of power.  
The flows do not, however, capture the efficiency with which different energy carriers 
provide useful energy services to consumers. The IVC, for example, leads to a marginally 
smaller overall energy system than the STEPS in 2040, but supports a larger economy. The 
SDS is even more efficient, as well as being much less carbon-intensive. This partly stems 
from its high degree of reliance on electricity. Given that electricity delivers useful energy 
services with better efficiency than other fuels, the role of electricity is greater in practice 
than its share in final consumption would suggest. 
 	 
Despite producing a smaller energy system than the STEPS in 2040  
the IVC supports a larger economy. 
 
In 2040, the SDS is more efficient and less carbon-intensive than the STEPS and the IVC. 
 


2.2 	The forces and uncertainties shaping energy demand 
Despite brisk economic growth in recent decades, India is still a lower-middle-income 
country. Even measured at PPP, its GDP per capita is almost 85% lower than that of 
advanced economies. Against this background, India's government wants to see substantial 
economic growth to raise living standards and reduce poverty. Over the projection period 
of this Outlook, 2019 to 2040, India's GDP is set to grow substantially. This will undoubtedly 
mean significant growth in demand for energy services. How this demand is met, which 
fuels and technologies are available and at what price, is a crucial issue for the aspirations 
and livelihoods of India's citizens. India's choices will in turn have a huge influence on global 
trends, against a backdrop of accelerating global action on climate change and 
commitments to reach net zero emissions. The objective of this section is to understand the 
macroscale drivers and uncertainties of demand growth in this new context. It starts with a 
brief review of historical energy demand growth before turning to the outlook period. 
2.2.1 	GDP and energy intensity 
Between 1990 and 2019, India's GDP increased more than sixfold, while total final 
consumption increased only by a factor of 2.5. In other words, GDP grew more than twice 
as fast as energy consumption. Three main factors contributed to this rapid improvement in 
the final energy intensity of GDP.  
The first was the structural transition away from traditional biomass as a fuel in the 
residential sector. Although India still consumes a large amount of traditional biomass, the 
share of total final consumption accounted for by biomass fell from 42% in 1990 to 18% in 
2019, as widespread electrification took place, oil consumption in transport grew and the 
buildings sector transitioned towards modern fuels. This transition in the buildings sector 
entailed a shift from traditional sources of biomass with very low conversion efficiencies (in 
the order of 5-10%) towards higher efficiency fuels such as LPG and electricity. The 
efficiency gains from fuel switching helped to enable substantial growth in economic 
activity without commensurate growth in energy consumption: the decline in traditional 
biomass was responsible for nearly 60% of the decline in energy intensity between 1990 
and 2019.  
The second driver of this dramatic improvement in energy intensity was the structure of 
India's economic growth model. Unlike East Asian or some Southeast Asian countries, such 
as Korea, China and Viet Nam, India's economic growth has historically been driven by the 
services sectors, not the more energy-intensive industry sectors. This is illustrated in Figure 
2.4, which shows that nearly 90% of total value-added growth in the period 1990-2017 
came from sectors in the lowest energy intensity category. These include large retail service 
sectors such as trade as well as very productive "low footprint" sectors such as business 
and financial services. India's service-oriented model of international trade has further 
embedded these less energy-intensive sectors in the domestic economy.  
Figure 2.4 ? 	Share in value-added growth by sector and level of energy 
intensity, 1990-2017 
 
The vast majority of value-added growth in the Indian GDP since 1990 has come from  low-
energy-intensity sectors. 
 
Note: Energy intensity is calculated as the ratio of the value of energy inputs to the value of gross output in 
thousand rupees, with a range of 0-100 classified as low, 100-200 as medium, and >200 as high. 

The third driver of the improvement in energy intensity has been the technical efficiency of 
production and consumption processes. Low levels of energy use per unit of physical 
output have been driven by relatively high energy prices, price sensitivity among 
consumers, a young capital stock, and a robust policy framework in a number of sectors. 
For example, the average on-road fuel efficiency of a new passenger car purchased in India 
is around 5.7 litres/100 km, comparable with cars purchased in the European Union. The 
thermal energy intensity of clinker production in India is 20% lower than in the European 
Union.  
Looking at India's recent energy demand growth, the picture that emerges is one of a 
relatively frugal energy system. Rapid improvements in energy intensity have been driven 
by a transition to more efficient fuels, a structure of economic growth dominated by 
services, and high technical efficiencies in many sectors. The extent to which these trends 
continue will be crucial in determining the future growth of Indian energy demand. 
2.2.2 	Outlook for GDP growth and economic structure in the STEPS 
Between 2019 and 2040, Indian GDP is projected in the STEPS to triple in size, growing 5.4% 
annually, while India's economic structure changes in ways broadly consistent with the 
historical trajectory charted by other countries. Agriculture continues to decrease as a 
share of GDP, albeit more slowly than in the past. By 2040, it accounts for about 11% of 
GDP. Consistent with India's services-driven development model, the share of industry in 
total GDP is projected to remain broadly stable over the outlook period, rising slightly from 
30% in 2019 to 31% in 2040. The share of services in GDP continues to increase, rising from 
54% in 2019 to 57% in 2040, with accompanying growth in service sector energy demand 
(see section 2.3).  
The tripling in GDP in the STEPS is accompanied by less than a doubling of total final energy 
consumption, which rises from 620 Mtoe in 2019 to just over 1 100 Mtoe in 2040. As in the 
past, a reduction in energy intensity is anticipated to play a substantial role in reducing 
energy demand growth relative to GDP growth. This is evident from a decomposition of 
different factors affecting demand growth (Figure 2.5).  

Energy intensity improvements include gains from energy efficiency as well 
as transitions to more conversion-efficient energy sources, such as electricity. Less traditional biomass 
represents the efficiency gains from switching away from traditional use of biomass towards modern fuels.  
As Figure 2.5 shows, GDP growth without any improvement in energy intensity would 
increase final energy consumption in India to more than 1 500 Mtoe by 2040, and a slightly 
expanded share of industry in the economy would add a little to this. However, this 
increase is in practice moderated by improvements in industrial energy intensity, which 
avoid around 140 Mtoe (explored further in section 2.4). The transition away from 
traditional use of biomass continues, as its share in final consumption contracts from 18% 
in 2019 to 6% in 2040, thereby avoiding a further 160 Mtoe. Finally, energy intensity 
improvements in all other end-use sectors and fuels bring about an additional reduction of 
150 Mtoe. Together, these three factors drive a cumulative reduction in the growth of total 
final consumption of over 440 Mtoe, an amount equivalent to Japan's total energy demand 
today.  
2.2.3 	Similar destinations, different pathways: Exploring the IVC and DRS 
The disruption from Covid-19 has caused an unprecedented level of uncertainty about the 
future of the global economy. India has suffered a significant economic contraction as a 
result of the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, and its economic output is expected to 
have fallen by around 8% in 2020 (IMF, 2021). In the STEPS, India's GDP returns to an 
annual average growth rate of around 5.4% per year between 2019 and 2040. However, 
substantial uncertainty remains about the depth and duration of the downturn induced by 
Covid-19, and the speed of the subsequent recovery in GDP growth rates. For this reason, 
two alternative scenarios have been used in this report alongside the STEPS and the SDS, 
namely the DRS and the IVC.  
In the IVC, GDP growth is higher across the outlook period, reflecting a scenario in which 
substantial structural reforms boost the long-term growth potential of the economy, 
despite the short-term shock of Covid-19. This scenario also assumes the achievement of 
ambitious government policy objectives related to energy efficiency, deployment of 
renewable energy, and the provision of modern fuels to households. The DRS, on the other 
hand, reflects a scenario in which the shock of Covid-19 continues to weigh on the 
subsequent economic recovery: precautionary household saving, high corporate debt levels 
and a strained fiscal deficit result in a slower rate of economic growth. Consequently, the 
structural transition in the energy system is also delayed, with fewer improvements in 
energy efficiency, slower deployment of renewables and natural gas, and a slower 
transition away from traditional biomass.  
The IVC sees an annual average GDP growth rate of 6% in the period 2019-40, compared 
with an annual average growth of 5% in the DRS. As a result, the size of the economy in 
2040 is 14% bigger in the IVC than in the STEPS, whereas it is 9% smaller in the DRS. On the 
face of it, one would expect that these differences in 2040 would drive substantial 
differences in energy demand and CO2 emissions. However, this is not the case. In the IVC, 
total final consumption of energy is actually lower than in the STEPS, and similar to that in 
the DRS. Stronger improvements in energy efficiency and faster moves towards more 
efficient fuels, notably electricity and gas, reduce the rate of final consumption growth in 
the IVC, notwithstanding its higher GDP. The similarly low level of demand in the DRS, by 
contrast, is a result of slower GDP growth and more prolonged economic challenges, which 
reduce the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and delay the transition towards more 
efficient fuels.  
Overall, energy-related CO  emissions are around 12% lower in both the IVC and the DRS 
relative to the STEPS in 2040, but the reasons for these similar-sized reductions are very 
different (Figure 2.6). In the IVC, emissions growth is lower as a result of faster energy 
efficiency improvements compensating for rapid economic growth; modern renewables 
partially compensating for the accelerated transition away from the traditional use of 
biomass; and the shift within the fossil mix towards natural gas. In the DRS, by contrast, 
emissions reductions come from low GDP growth, and from the persistence of traditional 
biomass in the energy mix, which reduces the carbon intensity of total primary energy 
demand relative to the STEPS but also means higher levels of air pollution and a greater 
number of premature deaths. Given the imperative of achieving economic growth, poverty 
reduction and the transition to welfare-enhancing modern fuels, these CO2 reductions are 
achieved at a very high social and economic cost.  

Similar changes in energy demand and CO2 emissions are seen in the IVC and DRS relative 
to the STEPS, but for very different reasons.  
income on purchasing more energy services. Finally, a country's urbanisation model locks in 
very long-lived patterns of energy demand; for example, sprawling urbanisation with little 
public transport demand can lock in higher transport energy consumption.  
How fast India urbanises, and with what urbanisation model, is therefore of material 
significance for its energy future. Exploring the long-term relationship between GDP per 
capita and the urbanisation rate offers some clues, comparing India with the East Asian 
lateindustrialising countries, Japan, Korea and China (Figure 2.7). Across the historical 
period assessed, the speed of India's urbanisation process, as its GDP per capita has grown, 
has been slower than in these other countries. India is projected to continue this historical 
trend and remain a relatively rural country in our scenarios, even as its GDP per capita 
grows. By 2040, India's urbanisation rate is projected to be just 46%, which is some 15-30 
percentage points lower than in the comparison countries at similar levels of GDP per 
capita.  
Despite this relatively low urbanisation rate, India's huge population means that there is 
still a massive absolute growth in the total urban population, from about 470 million in 
2019 to nearly 740 million in 2040. This increase in urban population is the equivalent of 
adding 13 cities the size of Mumbai to India by 2040. By contrast, India's rural population is 
expected to fall by 40 million in this period.  
Figure 2.7 ? 	Relationship between GDP per capita and the urbanisation rate 
in selected economies 
 
 India has not so far urbanised as fast as other countries have done historically. 
 
Maddison Project Database (2018). 
India thus looks set to buck the global trend between GDP per capita and urbanisation. This 
raises a number of important questions for India's energy future. First, given the strong 
relationship between development and urbanisation seen in economic history, will India be 
able to sustain a high level of GDP growth while retaining a high rural share of the 
population? Second, if India does retain a high share of rural population in the coming 
decades, what are the implications for India's energy future, given the observed differences 
between rural and urban households in terms of energy services demand and ownership of 
energy-consuming equipment?  
There is some uncertainty about whether the rather stringent definition of urbanisation 
that India applies belies the country's actual level of urbanisation. Indeed, India's definition 
of urbanisation has long been subject to debate. Indian states have an incentive to label 
areas as rural because this enables them to receive subsidies and exemptions that they 
would not otherwise be entitled to. Alternative definitions exist, based on population 
density per square kilometre, or the percentage of the population employed outside of 
agriculture. Other metrics, increasingly based on remote sensing, continue to provide 
mixed signals about India's "true" level of urbanisation.  
However, while there is debate about the stringency of India's definition of urban areas, it is 
clear that the definition is meaningfully reflected in energy indicators such as household 
appliance ownership. Persistent divergences have been evident in rural versus urban 
household appliance ownership for a long time, particularly for large, expensive 
energyintensive equipment such as cars or air conditioners. The extent to which there will 
be convergence in the pattern of energy service demand between rural and urban 
households is a question of great importance for India's future energy demand, given the 
large projected rural population share in 2040. The extent and physical model of India's 
urbanisation process - compact versus sprawling, high-rise versus low-rise, formal versus 
informal - will likewise be crucial in determining demand for energy-intensive materials 
such as steel and cement, as well as transport demand.  
2.3 	The built environment and mobility 
Two-thirds of the buildings that exist in 2040 in the STEPS have not yet been constructed. 
India is also facing a huge expansion of transportation networks - from highways, railways, 
and metro lines to airports and ports - to move an ever-increasing number of people and 
goods across the country. In the STEPS, around 300 million vehicles are added to India's 
roads by 2040, and there is a threefold increase in freight activity. How the built 
environment and India's transport systems interact is a crucial question for India's energy 
future. 
2.3.1 	The built environment 
There are three trends that underpin buildings energy demand in India. First, new 
construction activity is increasingly being concentrated in urban areas, making urbanisation 
a key driver for material demand; second, informal settlements and traditional built 
structures are being replaced by new buildings that use modern and energy-intensive 
materials such as bricks, cement and steel; third, there has been a steady growth in 
appliance use, with air conditioners emerging as the single most significant source of 
electricity demand in the buildings sector.  
Material demand in the buildings sector 
In the STEPS, urban floor space more than triples by 2040; this far outpaces projected 
growth of floor space in rural areas (Figure 2.8). This predominance of urban growth is a 
result of continued migration towards urban areas, rising incomes in urban areas that drive 
home ownership and investments in real estate, and a reduction in the number of people 
per household which reflects falling fertility rates and the splitting of larger families into 
multiple households.  
Figure 2.8 ? 	Residential floor space in India in the STEPS 
 
 
Historically, most built spaces in India were in rural areas, but urban demand for floor 
spaces is set to outpace rural demand over the next 20 years.

Indian cities have emerged as hubs for construction activity. India now has over 53 cities 
with more than a million residents, and a further 8 000 urban agglomerations, defined as 
areas with over 5 000 residents with a majority share of non-agricultural employment. The 
prevalence of multi-dwelling and multi-storey apartment buildings has steadily increased, 
with over half of all households in India's eight largest cities (each with a population of over 
5 million) located in buildings of this kind in 2018, up from a third in 2002 (Sai, 2020). 
India's construction boom has also been fuelled by a renewed focus on public housing. 
More than 150 million Indians live in unorganised informal settlements that lack basic 
infrastructure and services, and are often built as non-permanent structures on land that 
does not belong to the residents. These settlements have been targeted for replacement 
through public housing programmes that stretch back several decades. The government's 
various efforts in this direction were merged into the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY) 
scheme in 2015 with the overarching goal of "housing for all" by 2022. This public housing 
scheme aims to provide a house built with modern building materials for all those who are 
homeless and all those living in dwellings made using traditional building materials.  
This focus on public housing has had significant impacts on building energy demand: in the 
six years leading to March 2020, more than 15 million houses were constructed, and a 
further 7 million are now under construction in urban areas. The government reported that 
60 Mt of cement and 14 Mt of steel were used for the urban component of the 
construction (MOHUA, 2020). Moreover, as a part of PMAY, some informal settlements 
have been transformed into high-rise neighbourhoods, contributing to the growth in urban 
India's per capita floor space. 
There has been a steady increase in the share of new buildings constructed using modern, 
energy-intensive building materials such as cement, bricks and steel. 
 

In the past, there were clear differences in the way in which rural and urban houses were 
built. In 1990, only 30% of rural homes were built using modern building materials, 
compared with 75% homes in urban areas. The rest were built using traditional materials 
such as unburnt mud, cow dung and other organic materials. That has been changing 
rapidly. By 2018, 80% of rural and 97% of urban houses were being constructed using 
modern materials (Figure 2.9). Overall, steel and cement production in India in the STEPS 
nearly triples by 2040 as a result of growth in the stock of housing and of a further closing 
of the gap between urban and rural areas in terms of their use of modern building 
materials.  
Cooking and appliance ownership 
Cooking, heating, cooling and appliances are the four pillars of energy demand in buildings. 
In the STEPS, clean cooking (cooking that uses LPG, electricity, natural gas), appliances and 
cooling are responsible for the overwhelming majority of energy demand growth until 
2040. The use of traditional cooking fuels and heating using biomass halves by 2040, and is 
replaced by cleaner alternatives including LPG and electric space heaters (Figure 2.10). The 
share of buildings in final energy consumption falls on account of falling biomass use, but 
the widespread uptake of cooling and appliances means the share of buildings in total 
electricity consumption rises from 41% in 2019 to 48% in 2040. Under the IVC, households 
move away completely from traditional bioenergy by 2030 as they adopt clean cooking 
technologies.  
 
Appliance ownership in India has been growing and diversifying. In 1990, the only appliance 
that most households had was a ceiling fan. By 2019, televisions had also become quite 
commonplace, and the number of refrigerators was steadily increasing. By 2040, air 
conditioners, personal computers and washing machines are expected in the STEPS to 
become much more common, particularly in urban areas. Air-conditioning (AC) units see 
faster growth than any other household appliance over the period to 2040, and become the 
largest single driver of energy demand growth in buildings (Figure 2.11).  
Focus on cooling 
AC ownership is driven by the frequently hot and humid weather conditions in large parts of 
India. These conditions are being made more acute by rising temperatures stemming from 
global climate change and the "heat island effect" that affects urban areas in particular: as 
vegetation on land surfaces and water bodies have been replaced with impermeable and 
high-emissivity surfaces as part of the built environment, there has been an increase in 
temperatures in urban areas. With rising urban temperatures and per capita incomes, the 
growth in ownership of ACs is likely to become more broad-based, and it is expected to be 
led over the coming decades by mid- and low-income households in urban India (Kachhawa, 
Kumar, & Singh, 2019).  
In the STEPS, air conditioner stock reaches 670 million in 2040, up from 30 million today. As 
a result, India's consumption of electricity for cooling grows sixfold to reach 650 TWh by 
2040, which is more than the total electricity consumption of Germany today, and accounts 
for around half of all electricity consumption in buildings. Around two-thirds of this demand 
comes from the residential sector, with the remainder stemming from a steady rise in office 
buildings, retail, education, hotels and hospitals. Given that cooling demand peaks at 
certain times of the day and year for both residential and commercial buildings, this could 
put a considerable strain on India's ability to balance its grid and maintain reliable supply 
(see Section 3.2).  
The growth in cooling demand could be mitigated by energy efficiency improvements in 
ACs, as well as thermally efficient building design, cool roofs and the adoption of other 
more efficient cooling appliances including desert air coolers. Government action has the 
potential to underpin mitigation efforts, and the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP), which was 
launched in 2019, sets the scene for the future: it adopts the principle of "thermal comfort 
for all" including low-income groups, alongside a target to reduce cooling energy 
requirements by 25-40% by 2037-38, although the precise nature of this commitment is not 
clearly defined. 
A range of policies and measures that could lower cooling demand and the resulting energy 
use is already in place. The Energy Conservation Building Codes for commercial buildings 
and the Eco-Niwas Samhita for residential buildings already set energy performance 
standards for new buildings that have a minimum energy consumption threshold or floor 
area, while the standards and labelling programme covers 10 appliance categories including 
air conditioners. Under the STEPS, nearly a quarter of electricity demand growth for 
residential space cooling is avoided by efficiency measures by 2040, broadly in line with the 
target set out under ICAP. In the IVC, a more robust implementation of energy efficiency 
policies means that the electricity demand arising from an additional 130 million air 
conditioners is almost entirely offset by efficiency gains (Figure 2.12).  
Figure 2.12 ? The impact of efficiency measures on electricity demand from 
residential space cooling, 2019-2040 
 
Electricity demand in 2040 from cooling alone will be more than the total electricity 
consumption in Germany today; energy efficiency measures can moderate this growth. 
 
Building energy demand in the India Vision Case 
In the STEPS, India's energy demand from buildings in 2040 is 30% higher than in 2019. This 
net growth figure would be much higher still without the drop in energy demand that 
comes from the displacement of inefficient biomass by efficient clean cooking fuels such as 
LPG and PNG. If cooking energy demand were excluded, energy demand from buildings 
would double in the STEPS in this period, due to increased uptake of electric appliances 
including water heaters, refrigerators, ACs, TVs and lights.  
In the IVC, higher GDP growth means that ownership of appliances rises at a faster rate 
than in the STEPS, while greater disposable incomes means higher per capita consumption 
of energy services. These factors serve to push up energy demand, but there are 
countervailing forces that moderate the overall growth in consumption. First, there is an 
accelerated move away from traditional biomass towards modern fuels, as well as a parallel 
increase in appliance ownership, which raises the share of electricity in total energy use in 
buildings; both factors are instrumental in increasing the overall efficiency of energy use by 
India's building stock. Second, there are additional efforts to enhance India's efficiency 
policies, for example through more robust labelling and performance standards, as well as 
through stricter implementation of building codes covering insulation, shading and glazing, 
and other passive cooling solutions. As a result of these countervailing forces, energy 
demand from buildings grows in the IVC by only 12% over 2019 levels by 2040, less than 
half the level of growth seen in the STEPS.  
The stronger push on policy and implementation in the IVC results in important co-benefits 
for India's built environment. To take one important example, indoor air quality improves 
drastically on the back of a rapid fall in traditional biomass use, resulting in fewer 
premature deaths in the IVC than in the STEPS. These gains far outlast the clean cooking 
transition (which is complete before 2030), with energy demand in 2040 remaining 14% 
lower in the IVC than in the STEPS (Figure 2.13).  
Figure 2.13 ? Energy demand in buildings in the STEPS and the IVC, 2040 
 
In the IVC, energy demand from buildings in 2040 is lower than in the STEPS because 
policies in the IVC bring to an end the traditional use of biomass for cooking and heating. 
 
Note: Appliances includes cooling, lighting and all other electrical appliances.  
2.3.2 	Mobility  
The last three decades have transformed mobility in India. The economic reforms of the 
early 1990s laid the groundwork for a huge expansion in transport and communication 
activities. The rapid growth in almost all types of transport infrastructure since then has 
fuelled economic growth, which in turn has led to a continual increase in demand for 
mobility for both passengers and goods. These changes have led to both energy use and 
emissions in the transport sector increasing fivefold over the last three decades.  
Outlook for passenger mobility 
Around 270 million people are expected to be added to India's urban population in the next 
two decades. Unless carefully planned, urban transport infrastructure could become a 
potential bottleneck to India's growth and development. The Indian cities with more than 1 
million inhabitants already account for nearly 30% of total registered vehicles in India 
(MoRTH, 2019), and the level of vehicle ownership in urban households is higher than in 
rural households: in 2019, the motorcycle ownership rate was 1.4 times higher in urban 
areas and the passenger car ownership rate was twice as high. With growing disposable 
incomes and rapidly increasing motorised vehicle ownership, cities across India face the 
dual challenges of traffic congestion and poor air quality; Indian cities are consistently 
ranked high on the list of the most congested and the most polluted cities globally. 
Following the National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) of 2006, the last decade has seen the 
launch of programmes such as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, 100 
Smart Cities Mission, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation to 
build and upgrade urban transport infrastructure, with a focus on public transport. These 
initiatives underpin a planned expansion of metro railways, rapid transit systems and bus 
services across dozens of cities.  
While the focus of transport policies has been on passenger vehicles and mass transit, a 
significant share of mobility needs in India continue to be met by three-wheeled auto 
rickshaws, private motorised two-wheelers and non-motorised modes of transport such as 
cycle rickshaws and bicycles, as well as by walking (Box 2.1).  
Box 2.1 ? 	The role of non-motorised transport in urban India  
Non-motorised transport plays a major role in mobility in India (Figure 2.14). In urban 
areas, nearly 40% of trips are 5 km or less. People usually walk or cycle in these cases. In 
a typical week, over 60% of urban Indians walk or cycle on trips that average 2.5 km. As 
the average length of journey increases, however, they become more likely to switch to 
two-/three-wheelers, public transport and personal cars (CEEW, 2019). People using 
non-motorised transport generally do so because they cannot afford motorised 
transport. Without an appropriate focus on non-motorised transport infrastructure, 
these individuals could transition to two-/three-wheelers or passenger cars as their per 
capita incomes increase.  
There is a significant opportunity to avoid energy use in transport by ensuring adequate 
and safe pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in cities. Currently, Indian cities and towns 
rarely have extensive networks of walkable sidewalks or dedicated cycle lanes, and this 
forces non-motorised commuters to use roads meant for vehicular traffic instead, 
leading to a high number of fatalities from accidents. While the NUTP, launched in 2006, 
has an objective of "moving people and not vehicles", this has not yet led to sustained 
investment in safe infrastructure for non-motorised commuters.  
 
In the STEPS, the fleet of buses in India doubles by 2040 to reach a stock of 4.4 million. 
Efforts are being made to ensure that new bus fleets operate on fuels such as natural gas 
and electricity to reduce their impacts on local air quality. With about 6 200 buses, Delhi is 
home to one of the largest fleets of natural gas-powered buses in the world. However, 
public buses represent only 8% of India's total bus fleet (MoRTH, 2020). Efforts to transform 
bus operations therefore also require appropriate regulations and incentives to help private 
bus fleets move towards more efficient and cleaner fuel types.  
While efforts are under way to develop more organised forms of public transport, the 
growth in the motorisation of mobility in India is largely being driven by increases in 
numbers of two-/three-wheelers. More than 80% of vehicles in India are two-/three-
wheelers, and this vehicle category has grown faster than any other in the last decade 
(MoRTH, 2019). Three-wheeled auto-rickshaws help meet last and first mile mobility 
demands and, like buses, act as shared modes of transport operating on specific routes in 
both urban and rural settings. In some cities, they also operate as a metered service, like 
taxis. They operate on a wide range of fuels, including gasoline, diesel, LPG, natural gas and, 
in some recent cases, electricity. In the STEPS, the number of two-/three-wheelers on the 
road increases by over 55% by 2040. 
Passenger cars are the third-fastest-growing vehicle category in India, with annual average 
growth of around 10% over the last decade. Increasing disposable incomes and a growing 
range of available models mean that demand for cars is set to rise over the coming 
decades. Passenger cars are now subject to a CAFE energy efficiency standard with an 
upper limit of 5.49 litres/100 km, and this standard will become more stringent from 2022. 
Together with the Bharat Stage VI fuel quality standards and incentives for purchase of EVs, 
this should help to reduce the level of energy demand growth. At the same time the 
increasing use of shared app-based ride-hailing passenger services has the potential to 
make more efficient use of the stock of passenger cars and to reduce road congestion and 
local air pollution. In the STEPS, the stock of passenger cars nevertheless still grows fivefold 
between 2019 and 2040 to reach 200 million, outpacing the growth of all other vehicle 
categories. 
In the SDS, there is a concerted effort to move towards more efficient forms of 
transportation. As a consequence, the stock of buses and two-/three-wheelers is about 7% 
higher in 2040 than in the STEPS, while the stock of passenger cars is about 6% lower. In the 
IVC, buses and two-/three-wheelers grow at much the same rate as in the STEPS, but there 
are nearly 10% more passenger cars in 2040 than in the STEPS owing to the greater 
purchasing power of Indians.  
The electrification of road transport  
Road transport has historically been dominated by gasoline and diesel vehicles, but this is 
starting to change as a result of a range of policy initiatives and technology trends. India's 
vision for vehicle electrification was first outlined in the National Electric Mobility Mission 
Plan launched in 2012, which foresaw rapid growth in both the manufacturing and use of 
EVs in India.  
To increase the uptake of EVs, a subsidy programme called the Faster Adoption and 
Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) was introduced in 2015. The second phase of the 
policy, FAME-II, was approved in 2019 with a budget of $1.4 billion for a three-year period. 
This includes policy incentives for the purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles as well as for 
the deployment of charging stations. FAME-II aims to increase the number of electric buses, 
two-/three-wheelers and cars. Subsidies are available only for vehicles with advanced 
battery chemistries, rather than lead-acid variants that make up the majority of electric 
two/three-wheelers sold today. In addition to these policies, Energy Efficiency Services 
Limited, India's largest energy services company, has a bulk procurement programme in 
place to acquire 10 000 EVs for government use, although to date around 15-20% have 
been acquired. State and city governments have also introduced policies to incentivise the 
uptake of EVs.  
To ensure the development of EV charging infrastructure, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency 
has laid out targets for the installation of at least one publicly accessible charger within a 
grid of 3 km by 3 km in cities, and one charging station every 25 km on both sides of 
highways. There is an additional target of one fast-charging station every 100 km on 
highways. The government has also complemented its measures to promote the use of EVs 
and associated infrastructure by announcing a production-linked incentive for the 
manufacture of advanced chemistry batteries for EVs, renewable energy and other 
applications. 
As many of these incentives are relatively recent, much of the growth in electric passenger 
car numbers lies ahead. Fewer than 4 000 electric cars were sold in India in 2019. However, 
supportive policies, a growing global market for EVs and falling battery costs should soon 
put more EVs within reach of India's increasingly affluent middle classes. In the STEPS, there 
are nearly 7 million electric cars on the road by 2030, and 27 million by 2040.  
A more significant opportunity for electrification exists in the form of two-/three-wheelers. 
In 2019, India had a stock of 1.8 million electric two-/three-wheelers on the road, and 
battery-powered electric three-wheelers (also called e-rickshaws) are already serving the 
demands of over 60 million people per day, mostly in urban areas (Singh, 2019). Sales are 
modest in terms of the size of the overall market - around 740 000 electric two-/three-
wheelers were sold in 2019, accounting for about 3% of total sales - but are set to rise 
rapidly in the future. In the STEPS, there are 55 million electric two-/three-wheelers on the 
road in 2030, and they make up 19% of the total stock. This increases to 160 million in 
2040, by which time they account for over half the stock of such vehicles.  
Figure 2.15 ? Passenger car sales by scenario, 2019 and 2040 
 
Two- and three-wheelers see rapid electrification, but the speed at which the car fleet 
switches away from petroleum-based fuels varies widely by scenario.  
 
Note: ICE = internal combustion engine. 
There were very few electric buses on the road in 2019, but there have been recent efforts 
by the central government jointly with states and municipal corporations to roll out 5 600 
electric buses across 64 cities (for both urban and intercity movement) over the next few 
years (DHI, 2020). The number of electric buses grows to over 500 000 by 2040 under the 
STEPS, though they still account for only 12% of the stock. Overall, annual sales of EVs rise 
steadily in the STEPS (Figure 2.15). In all, the EV fleet - including two- and threewheelers, 
cars, vans, buses, and trucks - represents 34% of the entire road stock by 2040, with two-
/three-wheelers accounting for the vast majority of the total.  
Things look different in other scenarios. In the IVC, more aggressive implementation of 
electrification targets results in 25% of the passenger cars sold and nearly half of the two-
/three-wheelers sold being electric by 2030. By 2040, nearly 70% of all vehicles sold are 
electric. In the SDS, there is a much stronger policy push towards sustainable forms of 
mobility, together with a set of measures that support the domestic production of 
batteries, a rapid roll-out of charging infrastructure, and the implementation of building 
codes that encourage private charging. In the SDS, EVs constitute nearly half of all vehicle 
sales by 2030, and 86% by 2040. By 2040, 90% of the passenger cars sold are electric, up 
from 48% in 2030, and nearly 60% of the total vehicle stock is electric.  
The future of road freight  
India's steadily growing and more interconnected economy has led to a rapid rise in freight 
transport in recent years. Over 60% of goods transported in India travel by road (MoRTH, 
2020). In the past decade, freight road activity and the number of commercial freight 
vehicles have both doubled, and they are projected to more than triple from current levels 
under the STEPS, with the stock of commercial freight vehicles reaching 35 million in 2040. 
Almost 45% of the growth in freight activity between 2019 and 2040 comes from heavy-
duty freight trucks, which tend to serve long-distance routes, with a further 38% coming 
from the use of light commercial trucks, which largely serve urban centres within city limits 
(Figure 2.16). The growth in freight demand in the STEPS is mainly met by vehicles using 
diesel, with only small increases in the use of alternative fuels such as CNG. The increasing 
use of railways to transport freight does, however, avoid some growth in road freight 
activity 
(Box 2.2).  
Figure 2.16 ? Growth of road freight activity in India in the STEPS, 2019-2040 
 
Road freight activity in India more than triples by 2040 in the STEPS, with long-distance 
trucks and intra-city light commercial vehicles contributing most of the growth.  
 
Note: vkm = vehicle kilometres. 
While the level of freight activity in the SDS is similar to that in the STEPS, much more of it is 
transported by hybrid, electric, hydrogen and natural gas freight vehicles, with around half 
of the 30 million trucks in 2040 in the SDS being powered by technologies other than diesel 
ICEs. In the STEPS, by contrast, these alternative technologies account for only 6% of energy 
demand from India's trucks.  
Box 2.2 ? 	The transformation of India's railways  
Railways in India have a long pedigree, dating back more than 160 years to the pre-
independence era. By the time India gained independence in 1947, its railway network 
extended for more than 50 000 km. It has since grown to around 67 000 km, making it 
the fourth-largest railway network in the world. India's railway network was for a long 
time largely fuelled by coal and diesel. However, the share of electrified tracks has 
increased in recent decades, rising from 24% in 2000 to just over 50% in 2019. The share 
of electricity in total energy use by Indian railways has seen a corresponding increase, 
albeit at a more moderate pace (Figure 2.17).  
In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on transforming railways to make them 
a desirable option for long-distance transport as well as urban public mobility. Indian 
Railways has an ambition to fully electrify its tracks by 2023, which will entail the 
electrification of over 30 000 km of track within four years. In parallel, there is an 
aspiration for rail transport to become "net zero" emissions by 2030 by drawing its entire 
electrical load from renewable energy. 

There is also an interest in developing high-speed rail in India, with the first line being 
developed between the cities of Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Further lines are also being 
explored which could run between Mumbai and Delhi, between Delhi and northern 
Indian cities such as Amritsar and Varanasi, and between Mumbai and cities in the south. 
Despite high capital costs, high-speed rail has the potential to displace air traffic, leading 
to energy savings and emissions reductions.  
Railway operators are seeking to double the average speed of freight trains by 2023, and 
to increase their share of freight movement from 30% in 2019 to 45% by 2032. The 
Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) between India's four largest cities of Delhi, Mumbai, 
Chennai and Kolkata aims to create over 10 000 km of railway track that would be used 
solely by freight traffic on a route that accounts for nearly 58% of the revenue-earning 
traffic on the railways. The DFC is currently under construction, with some sections of it 
opening to traffic in 2020, and further sections targeted to open in 2022. As well as 
improving freight rail transport, the DFC will free up other lines for passenger use, which 
should lead to an improvement in average speeds across the railways.  
In addition, urban metro rail is expected to double in length: there are 650 km of lines in 
18 cities today, and a further 900 km of lines are now under construction across 20 cities. 
The most extensive metro network is in New Delhi, but there are growing networks in 
other cities. More than 4.5 million passengers use the metro in Delhi every day, while 
the metros in Mumbai and Bangalore each have daily ridership of more than 450 000 
people. As lines and stations expand, urban rail networks could potentially carry millions 
of additional daily commuters. This should reduce personal car travel and so prevent 
additional emissions and road congestion.  
Together, these efforts could help shift some road and flight transport activity to rail, 
which is among the most efficient modes of transport. The energy used per passenger 
kilometre in rail is roughly one-tenth that of passenger cars and planes, and one-third 
that of buses  (IEA, 2020).  
The outlook for transport energy demand and emissions 
Energy demand for road transport in the STEPS more than doubles by 2040 to reach 220 
Mtoe (Figure 2.18). Freight transport constitutes half of the overall increase, most of which 
is fuelled by diesel: in 2019, around 80% of freight transport relied on the use of diesel, a 
share that remains largely unchanged to 2040. Energy use in passenger cars quadruples 
over the 2019-40 period. Despite rapid growth in EV sales, especially for two-
/threewheelers, electricity consumption growth constitutes only 7% of the overall growth 
in road transport energy demand to 2040 under the STEPS. Under the IVC, this rises to 
nearly 15% of the overall growth in transport energy demand.  
Railway energy demand grows by over 80% through to 2040 in the STEPS, with electricity 
providing only half of the energy used by railways in India in 2040. In the IVC, however, the 
target of complete electrification is achieved. Energy demand from domestic aviation 
triples under both the STEPS and the IVC (although it is 10% higher in the IVC); it constitutes 
less than 1% of energy demand under both scenarios.  
Diesel-based freight transport underpins demand growth in the STEPS to 2040. Greater 
efficiency and an uptake in electric mobility is key to avoiding demand growth in the SDS. 
 
As a result of these demand increases, CO2 emissions from road transport double between 
2019 and 2040 in the STEPS, with around 65% of this increase coming from freight vehicles; 
road transport continues to account for nearly 90% of overall emissions in the transport 
sector. The scale of activity growth in the transport sector means that CO2 emissions also 
grow in the SDS in the period to 2040, largely as a result of a doubling in emissions from 
heavy-duty trucks. However, a number of developments in the SDS help to improve the 
sustainability of transport. EVs account for a far larger share of new vehicle sales in the SDS 
than they do in the STEPS; this means that electricity (which is increasingly supplied from 
low-carbon sources) accounts for nearly one-third of the growth in road transport energy 
consumption to 2040. More robust efficiency targets also help to lower energy demand and 
emissions, while the use of biofuels helps to lower the emissions intensity of liquid fuel 
demand. Alternative fuels including biofuels, electricity and natural gas together meet 30% 
of road transport sector energy demand in 2040 in the SDS, which is over twice the share in 
the STEPS.  
The result of these developments is that road transport emissions in the SDS begin to 
decline in the 2030s despite rising vehicle ownership and activity levels, and end up 42% 
below the level in the STEPS by 2040. This is primarily due to efficiency gains and an 
increasing share of passenger cars and road freight vehicles running on alternative fuels 
such as biofuels, CNG and electricity (Figure 2.19); two-/three-wheelers are already 
increasingly electrified in the STEPS. 
While two-/three-wheelers form a large majority of the stock of vehicles, the biggest 
opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions comes from passenger cars and freight transport. 
 
Industrial transformations 
The share of the industry sector in total final energy consumption increased from 28% to 
36% between 1990 and 2019, making it the largest end-use sector today, and a vitally 
important sector for India's energy future. 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown sharply reduced India's industrial 
activity. On an annualised basis, in the months from January to August 2020, cumulative 
production of steel fell by around 20% (OEA DPIIT, 2020). Tentative signs of economic 
recovery were visible in the second half of 2020, with monthly production of heavy 
industrial commodities returning towards their pre-crisis levels. However, in the absence of 
a burst of industrial activity at higher rates than those prior to the crisis, there is likely to be 
a prolonged reduction in activity relative to pre-crisis projections. For example, compared 
with the WEO 2019, the growth in real industrial value in the period to 2030 in the STEPS 
has been adjusted down by around 20%, with steel production down by a similar rate. 
Despite a pickup of economic growth rates after 2020, these industrial indicators remain 
lower in the STEPS than in WEO 2019 projections for the whole scenario period through to 
2040 (Figure 2.20). 
India's industrial energy consumption in 2040 in the STEPS is over 100 Mtoe (or 18%) lower 
than projected in the WEO 2019. This downward adjustment does not, however, affect all 
fuels equally. The downward revision falls hardest on coal, which is 34 Mtoe lower in 2030 
and 73 Mtoe lower in  040 than projected in the WEO 2019. Electricity consumption is 
down 21 Mtoe in 2040 and natural gas consumption is down 11 Mtoe (Figure 2.21). 
Figure 2.21 ? Industrial final consumption by fuel in the STEPS, WEO 2019 versus 
WEO 2020 
 
 
Covid-19 has dampened the projected rise in industrial energy consumption  
in India; by 2040, demand is 18% lower than in pre-crisis projections. 
Consequently, industry's share in total final consumption increases from 36% in 2019 to 
41% by 2040. In addition to final consumption of energy, the industry sector is responsible 
for the non-energy use of fossil fuels as industrial feedstocks, for example in petrochemical 
and fertiliser production. Total feedstock consumption in the STEPS grows from 22 Mtoe in 
2019 to 55 Mtoe by 2040, of which oil makes up 40 Mtoe and gas 13 Mtoe (the remainder 
being hydrogen and biomass feedstocks).  
Over the past three decades, almost three-quarters of the growth in coal demand went to 
power generation. In the STEPS, this dwindles to one-quarter, and instead almost two-
thirds of the growth in coal demand comes from industry. As a result, the industry sector 
accounts for the majority of CO2 emissions as well as the majority of total demand growth 
in India between 2019 and 2040 (Figure 2.22).  
Figure 2.22 ? Industry share in total final consumption, coal demand and CO2 
emissions growth in India in the STEPS 
 
In the STEPS, the dominance of renewables in power means coal pivots from power to 
industry, making industry responsible for the majority of growth in CO2 emissions to 2040. 
 
In the STEPS, real industrial value-added grows more than threefold from 2019 to 2040, 
driven by materials-intensive investments in infrastructure, urban housing, factories and 
productive equipment. The urban population is projected to grow from 470 million in 2019 
to 740 million by 2040, and total residential floor space from 19 billion m2 to over 50 billion 
m2. This massive urban transition underpins rapid growth in energy-intensive materials such 
as steel and cement. As a consequence of this robust growth in the industrial sector, India 
becomes increasingly central to global industrial energy demand (see Chapter 4).  
Between 1990 and 2019, the energy intensity of India's industrial value-added (i.e. the 
amount of energy required to produce an additional unit of industrial output) decreased by 
more than 50%. This was due, in part, to the general wave of economic efficiency 
improvements that occurred after liberalisation in the early 1990s; it was also a 
consequence of relatively high energy prices, as well as specific policies such as the PAT 
scheme. The energy intensity of India's industrial value-added is now relatively low by 
international standards: in 2019, it was below the G20 average (measured at PPP).  

Improvements in material efficiency and energy efficiency keep the rise in industrial 
energy consumption below the growth in industrial production and value-added. 
 
India's economic growth and the increasingly industrialised structure of India's GDP are key 
drivers of the projected increase in industrial energy demand to 2040.  Over the period to 
2040, industrial value-added increases faster than the production of physical outputs such 
as steel and cement (Figure 2.23). Total final energy consumption of the industry sector 
increases more slowly than either as a result of improvements in efficiency. These are 
partly the result of natural economic processes, as the economy becomes more efficient at 
extracting value from the factors of production, including materials and energy. They are 
also partly driven by policies aiming to improve material efficiency, for example through 
recycling and material reuse. In the STEPS, material efficiency avoids about 25 Mtoe of 
industrial energy demand growth over the period to 2040, while reductions in the energy 
intensity of the physical production of steel, chemicals, cement, paper, and aluminium 
avoid a further 150 Mtoe (Figure 2.24).  
Within the heavy industrial sectors, the largest potential for material and energy intensity 
improvements lies in the steel sector, which contributes more than half of the total energy 
savings from these sectors. Although much smaller individually, substantial energy savings 
from energy intensity improvements also come from India's light industry base. Energy 
savings from a range of less energy-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing, textiles and 
food processing, amount to a further 65 Mtoe in 2040 in the STEPS. These sectors include 
many small and medium-sized firms, underlining the importance of policies to tap the 
energy savings potential in India's large and often informal micro, small and medium-sized 
industrial sector (MSME). In total, energy savings from this segment avoid one-third of the 
projected growth in total industrial energy consumption (Box 2.3). 
Figure 2.24 ? Breakdown of the key drivers of industry energy consumption in 
India in the STEPS, and reductions in energy use from efficiency 
 
 
Improvements in the efficiency of material and energy use help to moderate the growth in 
Indian industrial energy consumption in the STEPS, but it still more than doubles to 2040. 
 
Note: Economic structure represents the impacts of the change in the share of industry value-added in GDP. 
Box 2.3 ? 	Energy efficiency in India's small- and medium-sized industries 
India's industry sector, like its economy more broadly, is characterised by a large number 
of small production facilities as well as a small number of large production facilities. The 
Sixth Economic Census recorded more than 10 million establishments in the 
manufacturing sector, including the informal sector, employing over 30 million people. 
This gives a sense of the huge scale of India's informal sector: the average establishment 
size in terms of employment was just three people. Although comprehensive energy 
consumption data is not gathered for the informal manufacturing sector, the Annual 
Survey of Industries provides data on the formal industry sector, and this data can be 
used to provide a sense of the scope for unlocking energy efficiency in the widely 
dispersed and fragmented landscape of small industrial installations. 
Across India's manufacturing sector, there are many facilities that have relatively little 
market share but that are substantially more energy-intensive than the best-performing 
facilities (Figure 2.25). In five of the six manufacturing sectors analysed, there is a clear 
 
2.4.2 	Pathways to a low-emissions industry sector 
In the STEPS, the industry sector is the largest driver of coal demand and CO2 emissions in 
India over the period to 2040. Total direct emissions from the industry sector nearly double, 
reaching just over 1 Gt CO2 in 2040. Although coal's market share drops from 44% in 2019 
to 38% by 2040, its consumption rises in tandem with India's increasing industrialisation, 
and it almost doubles from today's levels to reach 180 Mtoe by 2040. Coal remains a 
mainstay of several industries where there are few technically feasible alternatives for high-
temperature process heat. 
There are emerging opportunities to bend the industrial emissions curve in India by making 
further improvements in industrial efficiency, and some of these are reflected in the IVC. As 
a result, industrial value-added in the IVC is 15% higher than in the STEPS in 2040, even 
though industrial energy use is 3% below the level reached in the STEPS.  
An even bigger transformation of India's industry sector is seen in the SDS, with material 
efficiency playing an important role in reducing industrial emissions (Figure 2.26). For 
example, steel production in the SDS is 14% lower than in the STEPS in 2040, thanks to the 
lightweighting of products, longer product life cycles, and structural changes such as a shift 
to public and shared transport, which allows the same transport service demands to be met 
with fewer vehicles and hence fewer materials (IEA, 2019b). The share of energy-intensive 
clinker in cement drops in the SDS to 62% by 2040, compared with 68% in the STEPS, while 
the share of energy-saving secondary steel and secondary aluminium production increases 
by 3-5 percentage points. As well as demand reduction, material efficiency includes a host 
of process adjustments across multiple industry subsectors that collectively contribute 
almost a fifth of the additional industry emissions reductions seen in the SDS in 2040. 
Figure 2.26 ? Emissions reductions in the industry sector by abatement option 
between the STEPS and the SDS 
 
Multiple technologies and policy approaches are deployed in the SDS to bring down  
India's industrial CO2 emissions.  
 
Another 25% of the emissions reductions, more than 100 Mt CO2 in 2040, are achieved 
through improvements in energy efficiency. Many of these savings in the SDS are 
frontloaded because they can be delivered faster than savings from other options which 
rely on the deployment of novel technologies or on lengthy investment projects. Slightly 
less than a third of the total savings come from large industrial sectors such as iron and 
steel, cement, aluminium, chemicals, and pulp and paper. Two-thirds come from India's 
light industries, underscoring again the importance of extending energy savings policies and 
incentives to smaller energy-consuming sectors.  
Relatively few emissions reductions are achieved through the direct deployment of 
renewable energy in the industry sector, such as biomass and solar thermal for low-grade 
heat. More substantial emissions reductions are achieved by fuel switching, which covers 
moving from coal to gas, as well as moving to fuels with no direct emissions or to electricity.  
Almost a third of the difference between emissions reductions in the STEPS and the SDS 
comes from the deployment of CCUS in the SDS. By 2040, 125 Mt CO2 are captured in the 
industry sector, largely in the iron and steel, cement, and chemical sectors. Deploying CCUS 
on this scale would require timely investments in pipeline infrastructure, as well as 
substantial financial incentives, for example in the form of a carbon price or tax incentive 
combined with upfront capital support.  
A key conclusion emerging from this analysis is the importance of near-term measures to 
put India's industrial sector onto a sustainable pathway. India's stock of production capacity 
is relatively young, and is set to experience rapid growth in the coming decade to meet 
growing demand. Early deployment of best available technologies is the best way to reduce 
energy consumption and to enable the retrofitting of abatement technologies (IEA, 2020e). 
The iron and steel sector illustrates this point clearly (see below). 
Focus on transition pathways in the iron and steel sector 
The iron and steel sector is crucial to the transition of the overall industry sector in the 
SDS.  In 2019, energy consumption in the sector accounted for 13% of total energy-related 
CO2 emissions. In the STEPS, this rises to 17% by 2040 as iron and steel production grows 
and as other sectors, notably power generation, reduce their emissions footprint. The 
outcome in the SDS, however, is very different: indeed the iron and steel sector accounts 
for 10% of the difference in emissions reductions between the SDS and the STEPS in 2040 
(and almost half of the reductions achieved within the industry sector). However, achieving 
the level of emissions reductions in the SDS requires a comprehensive portfolio of 
measures.  
Currently, India is the world's second-largest producer of sponge iron, and the great 
majority of this iron depends on coal-based direct reduced iron (DRI) production. The 
sponge iron output of the coal-based DRI sector is refined into crude steel in electric arc 
furnaces and induction furnace sectors. Electric furnace production accounts for about 55% 
(60 Mt) of India's crude steel production; the other 50 Mt of crude steel production comes 
from blast furnace-basic oxygen furnaces (BF-BOF). In 2019, coal accounted for 88% of final 
energy consumption in the iron and steel sector, reflecting the sector's high degree of 
reliance on coal-based DRI and the low penetration of natural gas DRI. Electricity accounted 
for 10% of final consumption, with gas and oil products accounting for the remaining 2%.  
As in the broader industrial sector discussed above, material efficiency plays a crucial role in 
reducing the total demand for steel through measures such as vehicle lightweighting, 
building design optimisation, and design-driven extensions in product and building 
lifetimes. The 2019 National Resource Efficiency Policy signals government support for 
moving in this direction. In 2040, material efficiency contributes 36% of the difference in 
emissions reductions between the STEPS and the SDS in the iron and steel sector. 
Reducing the carbon intensity of fossil energy consumption, mostly through the deployment 
of CCUS, delivers a further 37% of the difference in emissions reductions between the STEPs 
and the SDS. By 2040, 63 Mt of CO2 are being captured from the iron and steel sector, which 
is 11% of the total CO2 emissions from the iron and steel sector in the STEPS scenario.  
Reducing the energy intensity of steel production contributes another 20% of the difference 
in emissions reductions achieved between the STEPS and the SDS, or a total of 40 Mt CO2. 
In the SDS, the energy intensity of steel production is 8% lower than in the STEPS by 2040. 
Increased uptake of best available technologies, such as coke dry quenching for coke ovens 
and top-pressure recovery turbines for blast furnaces, is the key here, supported by regular 
updating of efficiency targets under the PAT scheme against global standards and 
benchmarks.  
Fuel switching away from fossil fuels, largely towards electricity, contributes an additional 
12 Mt CO2 of emissions reductions, or around 6% of the difference between the STEPS and 
the SDS in terms of emissions. The potential for this is affected by the strong growth of 
Indian steel demand; this limits the scope for scrap-based secondary steel production, 
which is at present the only production method where the use of electricity is feasible. It 
does not, however, prevent all growth in the production of secondary steel: as a result the 
use of electricity increases in the SDS, and it accounts for 19% of energy consumption in the 
iron and steel sector by 2040. 
In the longer term, the deployment of alternative steel production routes is expected to 
play a stronger role in emissions reductions in the iron and steel sector. This includes 
hydrogenbased direct reduced iron (H2-DRI), which is deployed from the early 2030s 
onwards (Box 2.4). H2-DRI has the potential in time to provide a significant share of total 
steel production in India (IEA, 2020c). 
Box 2.4 ? 	Hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels for India's industrial 
transformation 
Energy efficiency, material efficiency and electrification are essential strategies for 
reducing emissions from industrial processes, but the technical requirements of these 
processes and the long lifetimes of existing industrial assets indicate that chemical fuels 
will continue to play a major role in India for some time to come, especially given the 
current fuel mix in industry: more than 60% of India's industrial energy demand today is 
met by the direct use of fossil fuels, more than half in the form of coal. Against this 
background, there is growing interest in fuel switching to bioenergy or other low-carbon 
fuels so as to allow the continued use of infrastructure and expertise that have been 
developed for fossil fuel use.  
In the STEPS, bioenergy demand in India's industrial sector rises by 80% between 2019 
and 2040. Solid biofuels can substitute for coal in many industrial heating applications, 
and low-carbon gases have the potential to meet demand for high-temperature heat and 
chemical feedstocks. India's biomethane consumption increases rapidly in the STEPS, 

rising above the level in both Europe and the United States by the early 2030s. In the 
SDS it rises further, displacing 30 Mtoe of potential natural gas demand in the process. 
We estimate that almost two-thirds of natural gas demand in India in the SDS could be 
met by biomethane for industrial and transport applications (IEA, 2020d). 
Low-carbon hydrogen has particular potential in the context of India's industry sector, 
since it can be used in place of natural gas, coking coal or oil products. This means that 
steel, ammonia-based fertilisers and methanol - among other products - could all be 
produced with low CO2 emissions. 
Low-carbon hydrogen can be produced by electrolysing water with low-carbon 
electricity, by reforming natural gas in combination with CCUS or, potentially, by 
methane pyrolysis. Given that India has relatively high natural gas prices, can produce 
low-cost renewable electricity and faces a high degree of uncertainty about its CO2 
storage potential, water electrolysis is likely to be the favoured option. Where CCUS is 
not available, the lowest hydrogen production costs are expected to come from pairing 
dedicated renewable power plants with electrolysers and local hydrogen storage to 
smooth the daily supply (TERI, 2020). India's existing industrial sites are well located for 
the use of local solar and wind resources, especially in Gujarat, Maharashtra and West 
Bengal. 
In the best locations, the cost of steady supplies of hydrogen from local renewable 
electricity could fall to between $20/MBtu and $30/MBtu by 2030 and decline further 
by 2050, even with the costs of on-site hydrogen storage included. However, such an 
outcome is subject to many uncertainties. Future cost reductions depend on cumulative 
deployment across a range of sectors nationally and internationally, and policies to 
support investment are not yet widely in place. In India, however, the policy outlook 
brightened in late 2020 with the announcement that a National Hydrogen Energy 
Mission is to be launched. 
In 2020, several governments announced plans to incentivise demand for hydrogen and 
electrolyser factories as part of their economic recovery spending, and this should 
benefit technology importers by lowering global prices and demonstrating 
effectiveness. For steel, in particular, further refinement of hydrogen-based production 
processes is needed before decisions are made about deployment. If planned projects 
receive the required funding, then iron reduction with 100% hydrogen could be 
demonstrated between 2025 and 2030. Among other things, this would provide insights 
into the optimal balance between oversizing renewable electricity capacity and 
installing on-site hydrogen tanks for round-the-clock operations, which is a key issue for 
India. The availability of low-carbon hydrogen at competitive costs could also pave the 
way for its use in ammonia for fertilisers, depending on the availability of non-fossil 
carbon for its conversion to urea and the market response to any resulting changes in 
urea prices. In time, low-carbon hydrogen has the potential to be cost-competitive with 
natural gas, displace imports and attract investment in the value chain. In the short 
term, funding for 
research that develops relevant skills as well as opportunities for entrepreneurs would 
help hydrogen's prospects. Looking further ahead, India has significant potential to 
become an international hub for hydrogen technologies if it develops the value chains to 
support this and offers opportunities for investment (see Chapter 4). This could give 
India a competitive edge in attracting gas-based and electricity-based industries in the 
future. 
 
 The Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated many of the challenges facing fuel suppliers and 
electricity generators. To some degree this has worked to India's advantage, as 
lower prices ease its fuel import bills. But strained balance sheets and uncertainties 
over demand also affect the prospects for domestic energy investment and supply. 
The longer-term effects of the pandemic are likely to vary significantly by fuel and 
technology. In the STEPS, India's gas supply (production plus trade) in 2030 is only 
slightly below the levels projected in WEO 2019, but oil supply is down by 5%, and 
coal is down by one-quarter. The pandemic takes more than 500 TWh off electricity 
generation in 2030 in the STEPS, compared with pre-crisis projections, with the 
brunt of the reduction being borne by coal-fired generation. 
Despite the shock from Covid-19, India's electricity demand is still projected to grow 
by almost 5% per year to 2040 in the STEPS, which is nearly double the rate of 
energy demand as a whole. India adds capacity the size of that of the European 
Union to its installed base over the next two decades, with solar PV and wind 
accounting for more than three-quarters of the capacity additions as their costs fall. 
By 2030, new solar PV, whether alone or paired with battery storage, becomes 
competitive with existing coal-fired power.  
The rise in demand for electricity brings with it much greater variability in both 
supply and demand. On the supply side, this reflects the growth in solar PV and 
wind. On the demand side it is related in large part to a six-fold increase in peak 
daily electricity consumption for air conditioning to 2040; higher efficiency 
standards for this equipment could remove the need for $9 billion to $15 billion of 
investment in peaking plant capacity. 
India's requirement for power system flexibility rises faster than anywhere else in 
the world in the STEPS, and it is higher still in the IVC and SDS. The achievement of 
ambitious renewable energy targets which call for 450 GW of non-hydro capacity by 
2030 has to be accompanied by a transformation of the power system in order to 
accommodate this growth, and this requires flexible operation of the coal-fired fleet, 
robust grids, and battery storage and demand-side response. 
India's ambition to become a "gas-based economy" comes at a time of ample 
international supply. However, price remains a very sensitive issue for Indian 
consumers, especially given the complex patchwork of additional charges and tariffs 
that turn an average wholesale cost of gas in 2019 of $6/MBtu into an estimated 
average end-user price of $12/MBtu. If all proposed gas infrastructure were to be 
built, some 70% of India's population would have access to gas, up from around 3% 
today, but there remain a host of permitting and financing challenges. 
Figure 3.1 ? 	Change in fuel supply and installed electricity capacity by 
scenario, 2019-2040 
The outlook for fuels in India varies strongly by scenario,  
but the expansion of the power system is rapid in all cases. 
In the STEPS, growth in gas consumption is concentrated in the industrial sector and 
in city gas distribution; in the IVC and in SDS, gas consumption also displaces 
significant amounts of coal in the power sector. The projections in the IVC and SDS 
underline that India's vision for gas cannot be limited to natural gas of fossil origin if 
the country is to meet its environmental and sustainability objectives; it needs to 
incorporate an expanding role for low-carbon gases, biomethane and hydrogen, 
where India has major potential as well. 
India's ambitions to reduce import dependence for oil and coal rest in part on 
expanding domestic supply. Despite ongoing efforts to improve the investment 
framework, this is challenging in the oil sector because of the complexity and the 
relatively limited size of the domestic resource base. In the case of coal, the 
domestic resource base is large enough to support increased production, but today's 
steep coal production targets are difficult to reconcile with India's evolving energy 
needs and environmental priorities.  
Adapting India's coal industry to these evolving needs and priorities requires 
concerted efforts to improve operational efficiency. It also requires the 
incorporation of new technologies to relieve environmental impacts, including CCUS, 
as well as alternative approaches to cooling at coal-fired plants: more than 80% of 
coal plants today are cooled by freshwater sources, and over half of these are in 
areas experiencing high water stress. 
3.1 	Overview of energy supply  
3.1.1 	Pathways out of today's crisis 
Energy supply in India has been affected in multiple ways by the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
economic effects of the pandemic have exerted strong downward pressure on international 
energy prices, and a period of well-supplied markets is set to ease India's import bills for 
some time to come. Given its heavy reliance on imports, this is good news for India. 
However, the strains on international suppliers are matched in many respects by pressures 
on domestic producers and investors. In the power sector, the effects have varied strongly 
by fuel: as in other parts of the world, thermal generation bore the brunt of the downward 
pressure on electricity demand in 2020, while renewable output was more resilient. 
Pathways out of today's crisis are highly dependent on the broader macroeconomic 
context, linked in turn to the duration and severity of the pandemic. But they also depend 
on the responses of policy makers and companies. Alongside wider efforts to stimulate the 
economy, India instituted three important energy market reform steps in mid-2020, which 
have led to the creation of real-time power markets (RTM), the Green Term-Ahead Market, 
and the India Gas Exchange (IGX). India is also taking steps to stimulate domestic 
production as part of a drive to reduce reliance on imports, especially of oil and coal. These 
efforts may bear fruit in the case of coal, but crude oil and condensate production is 
projected to fall below 650 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) in the late 2020s in the STEPS, 
with a slow but steady decline thereafter.  
Natural gas is one area where international market conditions and India's aspirations are 
well aligned. India's ambition to become a "gas-based economy" fits well with the interest 
among many exporting countries and companies in gaining a foothold in India's market, 
even though there are uncertainties around the business model for financing new projects. 
Efforts to expand India's LNG regasification capacity and its domestic gas grid are well 
under way although, as examined in detail in section 3.3 below, there is still much scope to 
rationalise a complex regulatory and tariff landscape for gas. Natural gas production, which 
has seen a significant drop in 2020, is set to rebound relatively quickly as new offshore 
developments come online.  
In the power sector, much will depend on the pace of recovery in industrial and commercial 
power demand. Approvals of new utility-scale solar have remained robust through the 
downturn, and a gradual recovery may well lead to much of the growth being taken by a 
continued flow of new renewable projects. A sharper rebound in demand, if the pandemic 
can be brought under control quickly, would offer greater near-term upside for 
conventional generation. In the projections in the STEPS, the pandemic takes more than 
500 TWh off electricity generation in 2030, compared with the projections in WEO 2019, 
with coal-fired generation taking most of the hit.  
3.1.2 	Perspectives to 2040 
The effects of the pandemic leave India in the STEPS with an economy that is nearly 20% 
smaller by 2040 than projected in WEO 2019, which means a drop in average annual energy 
demand growth from 3.2% to 2.5% compared with WEO 2019. However, the impact of this 
downward adjustment is not felt equally across fuels. By 2030, natural gas demand is back 
to the level projected in the WEO 2019, and oil demand is only slightly lower. By contrast, 
there is a significant downward revision for coal, which is a third lower in 2040 than in pre-
crisis projections. 
Ambitious efforts to raise the production of coal bear some fruit, meaning domestic output 
grows by 150 Mtce between 2019 and 2040. However, this is well below the previous level 
of growth recorded between 2000 and 2019, which saw a doubling in production. India 
manages to reverse the trend towards an increasing share of imports, keeping the share of 
imports below 30% through to 2040; the quality of domestic coal and the pivot towards a 
greater share of coking coal in India's coal balance effectively create a floor for imports.  
In the STEPS, India continues to transition away from the traditional use of solid biomass, 
primarily through the use of imported LPG. Demand for LPG doubles between 2019 and 
2040. Most of the rest of oil product demand is met by India's refinery sector, where 
capacity swells to nearly 8 mb/d by 2040. India's oil production continues to see a 
moderate decline, as new developments are unable to keep pace with declines from 
existing fields. By 2040, India's oil import dependence exceeds 90%. 
The shift away from traditional biomass occurs in parallel with a rise in the use of modern 
solid biomass for power generation and industry. At the same time, transport biofuels 
increasingly make their mark on liquid fuel demand, while biomethane use in the transport 
sector rises to almost 10 bcm by 2040. Together, these two bioenergy sources reduce oil 
import requirements by nearly 20 Mtoe (an amount equivalent to a fifth of oil consumption 
in the road transport sector today). Natural gas is poised for significant growth, backed by 
ambitious government targets to raise its share in the energy mix. Some offshore 
deepwater developments in the Krishna Godavari basin support near-term production 
growth, and there is then a slow but steady rise in coalbed methane production from the 
2030s. The level of growth in domestic gas production is, however, insufficient to meet 
rising demand, and LNG imports satisfy nearly 70% of demand growth, making India a 
major importer, and an important presence in global gas markets.  
In the IVC, total energy demand is slightly lower in 2040 than in the STEPS, even though 
GDP growth is higher as a consequence of greater energy productivity, particularly as India 
moves away from the use of traditional biomass. There is much greater progress towards 
the targeted 15% share of gas in the energy mix, a development that is accompanied by 
higher domestic gas production. Oil production remains at around the same levels as in 
STEPS, however, and growth in coal production is muted by an accelerated pace of 
renewables 
deployment that further erodes coal's share in power generation. 
Notes: Nuclear fuels not included. Other natural gas production includes shale and tight gas.  
The outlook for fossil fuels is much more subdued in the SDS (Table 3.1). Low-carbon energy 
sources capture nearly two-thirds of total demand growth to 2030, and by 2040 fossil fuels 
are largely absent from the new pipeline of projects. The most dramatic change occurs in 
the power sector, where unabated coal is virtually eliminated by 2040. Oil consumption 
peaks in the 2030s before entering a decline, creating a host of challenges for India's 
refining sector: up to 430 kb/d of refinery capacity is "at risk" through the 2030s, remaining 
largely unutilised in the SDS. Gas demand, by contrast, is relatively robust, as gas is used as 
a substitute fuel for both coal and oil to a much greater extent than in the STEPS and IVC. 
As a result, total gas demand reaches around 210 bcm by 2040, which is even higher than 
the level reached in the 
Electricity demand grows much faster than overall energy demand in all of the scenarios 
examined, putting electricity at the centre of India's modernisation (Table 3.2). The 
transformation of India's electricity sector also gains ground. In the STEPS, variable 
renewable energy sources make up a larger share of total electricity generation than coal 
by 2040. Installed solar capacity exceeds 700 GW by 2040, enough to meet nearly a third of 
India's power demand. This rate of growth is supported by the wide-scale deployment of 
batteries.  
 
3.2 	What's next for India's power sector? 
The last decade has been remarkable for India's power sector. Synchronisation of the grid 
was achieved in 2013, making it one of the world's largest. A large-scale electrification 
programme has achieved near-universal household access to electricity, and more than 
$200 billion has been spent on transmission and distribution networks over the last ten 
years. 
As a consequence, India has become the fourth-largest electricity market in the world, after 
the United States, China and the European Union. Electricity has enabled a burgeoning 
middle class to own modern appliances and sustain an increasingly digitalised lifestyle. 
Electricity demand growth is now widely used as a key barometer of India's overall 
economic performance. On the supply side, the explosive growth of utility-scale PV, 
supported by competitive auctions, has made India a global leader in the solar market. Six 
Indian states now source 10-30% of their electricity from variable renewable sources.  
There are, however, several challenges ahead. As described in detail in Chapter 4 (section 
4.3), a key issue is the fragile financial health of state-owned electricity distribution 
companies ("discoms"). This fragility has significant knock-on effects on the rest of India's 
power sector, affecting the finances of power generators and their investment risks, the 
level of technical and commercial losses in electricity distribution, and ultimately the quality 
of electricity supply to millions of Indian households and businesses.  
Figure 3.2 ? 	Electricity indicators in India, 2010-2020 
 
India has seen remarkable growth in capacity additions and achieved universal access to 
electricity, but Covid-19 has aggravated a pre-existing slump in demand and investment. 
 
Another key question is how much the pandemic might set back the transformation of the 
sector (Figure 3.2). So far, renewables have weathered the shock from Covid-19 relatively 
well; as of September 2020, around 8 GW of new solar capacity had been auctioned during 
2020, with tariffs around 4% lower on average than in 2019 (IEA, 2020b). However, there is 
greater uncertainty around the longer-term outlook for solar PV, with the Covid-19 
pandemic sharpening several existing structural challenges. A drop in industrial and 
commercial demand has left discoms with a customer base that includes a greater share of 
residential households and agricultural consumers paying tariffs that often lie below the 
cost of production, while perceived credit risks are growing as several existing projects 
experience delays and cancellations. The challenges are not restricted to solar: wind 
capacity additions in 2020 are expected to drop to their lowest level in a decade. The hard-
won gains of nearuniversal household access are also at risk as the economic downturn 
translates into fewer customers able to afford a basic bundle of electricity services. 
Both the opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead are enormous. Auctions have 
revealed how cost-competitive solar power has become, and long-term renewable 
deployment targets are well within reach. In the STEPS, India is second only to China in 
terms of new installed renewable capacity to 2040. However, this rise will have huge 
implications for the operational flexibility required across India's power sector. Reconciling 
the desire for a cost-reflective and efficient power system with the imperative to provide 
affordable, equitable supply of electricity is going to require a skilful balancing act. 
3.2.1 	India's evolving power system 
Electricity demand 
In the STEPS, India's electricity demand grows by 4.7% each year, nearly double the rate of 
energy demand as a whole. The widespread uptake of household appliances means that the 
share of electricity in total energy demand in buildings rises from 20% today to almost 50% 
by 2040. Further electrification of India's energy system also drives significant demand 
growth; there is a much greater use of power in certain industrial applications requiring 
lowtemperature heat supply, and a rise in the use of electricity as an input to steelmaking. 
Higher uptake of EVs, particularly two- and three-wheelers, enables electricity also to make 
inroads into the transport sector.  
In the STEPS, significant additional electricity demand is accompanied by changes in daily, 
monthly and seasonal load profiles. Currently, the average hourly variation in demand over 
the course of the year averages around 17 GW. This increases to 100 GW in the STEPS by 
2040. Peak daily demand rises nearly threefold, although the downward revision to 
macroeconomic growth means this rise is 15% lower by 2040 than in pre-crisis projections 
(Figure 3.3). 
Cooling systems are a major driver of the increased variability of demand. By 2040, the 
difference between the lowest and highest air-conditioning load over the course of a day 
reaches over 200 GW, compared with less than 40 GW today. This increase in the use of 
space cooling systems translates into an average annual increase of almost 10% in 
electricity demand for cooling over the projection period, and into new demand peaks. 
Commercial cooling systems see their consumption peak around midday, while household 
air conditioners see a peak in the early evening.  
More than half a billion air conditioners and fans are purchased by 2040 in the STEPS,  
significantly raising the evening peak, although not as high as in pre-crisis projections. 
 
The size of the impact of increased use of cooling systems on the daily peak of electricity 
demand is subject to several uncertainties. One important factor is how purchases of air 
conditioners divide between higher- and lower-income households, as higher-income 
households are more likely to run air conditioning more frequently, with less regard to cost. 
The efficiency of air conditioners purchased in the coming years will also have a significant 
impact on the daily peak, and efforts are under way to strengthen minimum performance 
standards. If measures are implemented that restrict sales of the least efficient models, this 
could reduce peak demand considerably. However, the timing of such measures is critical, 
as every year in which standards are not tightened means a progressively larger annual 
increase in peak demand. If measures are implemented in 2021, more efficient appliances 
could decrease the contribution of residential cooling to peak daily electricity demand in 
2030 by a third, or around 25 GW. This would obviate the need for around $9 billion to $15 
billion of investment in peaking plant capacity. It would also be possible to lower peak 
demand by having ACs operate more flexibly, as part of a demand response programme; 
improvements in the efficiency of building envelopes or a bigger roll-out of more passive or 
mixed-mode cooling systems could also contribute to a reduced peak. 
In addition to cooling, there are several uncertainties about the shape of electricity demand 
in other parts of the energy sector. For example, government programmes supporting 
charging infrastructure in cities or places of work could lead to a greater proportion of 
electricity demand from transport taking place during working hours, providing a good 
match with solar PV availability. There are other emerging opportunities for shifting peak 
load to different times of day to help balance supply and demand, such as off-peak charging 
or shifting the timing of the operation of agricultural pumps. India could provide a vital 
testing ground for the larger-scale adoption of such demand-side response (DRS) systems, 
although there are numerous technological prerequisites, such as advanced load prediction 
and control tools, real-time metering of electricity, and time-of-use tariffs.  
Electricity supply 
The task of managing the daily variability of demand, and in particular coping with the level 
at which demand peaks, is a crucial part of electricity system operation and planning. This 
task is made more challenging by the scale of growth in variable renewables over the next 
decade. In the STEPS, India adds nearly 900 GW of wind and solar capacity over the period 
to 2040. Solar PV leads the charge (Figure 3.4). The vast majority of capacity additions are 
from large, utility-scale projects; the share of distributed solar PV in the STEPS remains low 
because of its relatively high cost compared with large-scale solar projects and the logistical 
and regulatory challenges which have slowed capacity growth to date (Box 3.1). 
Figure 3.4 ? 	Changes in coal and solar capacity and share of power generation 
in India in the STEPS, 2000-2040 
 
India's power sector is on the cusp of a solar-powered transformation which will  challenge 
the long-established position of coal as "king" of India's power sector.  
 
Despite being seen as something of a junior partner to solar, wind is the second-largest 
source of capacity growth in the STEPS, with an additional 200 GW underpinned by 
ambitious targets to exploit India's significant potential for both onshore and offshore wind. 
Although wind power is also a variable resource, it can complement solar effectively in 
India; the monsoon season from June to September, which is a period of relatively lower 
solar resource availability, brings higher output from offshore wind projects than the rest of 
the year (IEA, 2019). 
Box 3.1 ? 	A new dawn for rooftop solar? 
India has ambitious targets to reach 40 GW of rooftop solar by 2022. However, rooftop 
PV deployment has been slow, with around 3 GW of capacity installed since 2015 
compared with 30 GW for utility-scale solar. This is due in part to the challenge of 
reconciling different commercial incentives under the current regulatory regime: a large 
number of residential consumers pay low, cross-subsidised electricity tariffs, reducing 
or in some cases eliminating the savings possible from self-consumption. Many 
consumers are also unable to afford the upfront costs of installation, and find it 
challenging to access finance, despite options to spread low-interest payments over a 
longer-term loan period. Those consumers that pay higher tariffs have greater 
incentives to install rooftop solar, especially as net-metering regulations would allow 
them to benefit from selling surplus solar back to the grid. If they were to move to 
rooftop solar, however, this would further erode the revenues of financially weak 
discoms, which lack commercial incentives to expand into rooftop solar.  
Some organisations are well-placed to push ahead with distributed solar - these include 
those with commercial installations on government buildings and entities taking part in 
the central public sector undertakings scheme. There are several incentives in place, 
including tax relief, subsidies, grants and credit guarantees for MSMEs. Rooftop PV 
projects are also eligible for housing improvement loans at preferential rates. There are 
in addition multiple opportunities for aggregation and economies of scale which have 
the potential to reduce the cost of supply for self-consumption, and increase the 
availability of financing. Raising consumer awareness and easing the administrative 
burdens associated with rooftop PV for households and undertakings, whilst ensuring 
that discoms share in the benefits of rooftop solar, could also unlock greater growth.  
In the STEPS, the vast majority of new solar added from 2019-40 is utility-scale, but a 
more hospitable regulatory regime ensures a gradual increase in the rate of additions of 
solar PV in buildings, with total installed capacity reaching 150 GW by 2040. 
There are also capacity additions in the STEPS from other low-carbon generation sources, 
notably nuclear and hydropower. India has a total of six nuclear reactors under 
construction, and these will add more than 4 GW to the 7 GW fleet by the late 2020s. In the 
STEPS, India continues to expand its fleet of nuclear reactors to complement the rapid 
growth of renewables. As modern large-scale reactor designs move past first-of-a-kind 
projects, construction periods and costs are set to fall, enabling India to add more than 25 
GW of nuclear power capacity between 2019 and 2040. Hydropower also expands, with 
total capacity doubling over the next two decades to about 100 GW in 2040. The vast 
majority of this growth is in the form of large hydro projects, which manage to overcome 
significant hurdles such as land access and permitting challenges. Government initiatives to 
improve project viability, including HPOs and financial support for enabling infrastructure, 
enable these new projects to tap a significant share of the remaining hydro potential in 
India. 
This supply picture means that variable renewable sources make up three-quarters of new 
capacity additions over the next two decades. With this immense growth, the question 
arises: to what extent is there a need for new thermal capacity? Over the next 10 years, the 
strong growth of renewables is not sufficient in the STEPS to keep up with the projected 
pace of electricity demand growth, and coal-fired power generation makes up the 
difference, increasing by over 200 TWh from 2019 to 2030. Much of this increase comes 
from more intensive utilisation of existing capacity, but new coal-fired capacity of over 20 
GW in the next decade is also required in the STEPS to provide additional generation and 
extra flexibility, with capacity under construction making up for upcoming retirements. As 
of September 2020, up to 60 GW of coal-fired capacity were designated as being under 
construction (CEA, 2020), but only half of these are completed by 2030 in the STEPS. 
The need for additional fossil-fuelled capacity in India wanes after 2030 in the STEPS. With 
mature technologies and supply chains, renewables meet about 90% of demand growth in 
the 2030s in the STEPS. With the additional contribution of nuclear power, there is no need 
for additional fossil-fuelled generation, and coal-fired capacity begins to decline in the 
2030s in the STEPS, with closures outweighing another 16 GW of capacity additions, 
bringing to an end the consistent growth of the industry over the past 60 years. Gas-fired 
capacity increases in part to offset reductions in coal, but principally to help meet rising 
power system flexibility needs. 
3.2.2 	Unlocking India's system flexibility over the next decade 
In the STEPS, by 2030 wind and solar PV reach a share of more than 40% in total installed 
capacity and around a quarter of total generation. The hour-to-hour variation in wind and 
solar output places increasingly large demands on the rest of the power system to balance 
supply and demand. WEO's detailed power model shows that hourly variations in these 
renewable sources in the STEPS increase more than threefold by 2030 (Figure 3.5). This 
puts India ahead of all other countries in its total requirement for flexibility.  
Flexibility requirements are determined by the load shape of demand and the electricity 
generation mix and capacity that can meet this. The integration of variable renewable 
energy sources (VRE) into electricity systems can be categorised into six distinct phases, 
which can help to identify relevant challenges and integration measures (IEA, 2018). The 
first phase is a situation where VRE has no noticeable impact on the power system, while 
the sixth phase calls for transformative technologies - such as seasonal power storage - to 
manage a largescale surplus or deficit of VRE supply. By 2030, with VRE providing around 
25% of India's total power generation (and with some states even further along the curve), 
advanced technologies and robust grids are necessary to ensure reliable operation of the 
power system. 
Flexibility can be provided by a range of resources with varying levels of maturity. Potential 
sources include conventional thermal and hydro generation, battery storage, demand 
response (in areas such as cooling or smart charging of EVs), and - if properly managed - 
variable renewable energy itself. There are a number of regulatory mechanisms that India is 
either implementing or actively exploring which would encourage greater uptake of such 
flexibility resources. An innovative round-the-clock auction was held in 2020, marking a 
step forward in ensuring that future renewable power projects are able to deliver power 
reliably when required. There are also continuing efforts to liberalise markets and, 
concurrently, to ensure that technical attributes such as ramping capacity are adequately 
valued.  
Figure 3.5 ? 	Hourly change in generation from variable renewables in India as 
percentage of average annual demand in the STEPS 
 
India faces a huge need for power system flexibility  
as much more solar and wind are added to the mix. 
 
Coal as a source of system flexibility 
In the wake of Covid-19, coal has been acting as the main source of flexibility in India's 
power system. Changes to regulations have reduced the minimum technical load factors of 
coal plants run by the central government from 70% to 55% since 2010. Though this entails 
added costs, particularly for older plants, it improves their ability to support the integration 
of VRE into the power system.  
For many coal-fired power plants in India, power purchase agreements (PPAs) are based on 
a principle of fixed cost recovery based on declared availability, not actual generation. For 
these plants, lower output as a result of higher VRE will not lead to financial distress, as 
fixed costs can be recovered. Nonetheless, lower output and more frequent and faster 
ramping may lead to increased variable costs, and potentially to some need for investment 
in technical upgrades, as well as increased wear and tear of equipment. These additional 
costs will need to be recovered from consumers. Regulatory commissions could address 
this concern through targeted programmes for upgrades and tariff premiums for flexible 
operations, and measures of this kind are already being implemented in some states. For 
coal-fired power plants without long-term PPAs, lower output and higher costs could create 
more serious financial challenges.  
Appropriately remunerating the provision of flexibility services by coal-fired power plants is 
essential to ensure the wide availability of flexibility that will be critical for operations by 
the end of the decade. In the STEPS, for example, the load factor across the entire coal fleet 
in 2030 drops below 25% for parts of the year. Achieving the degree of flexibility needed 
will require all coal plants to be technically ready, have the appropriate incentives, and be 
dispatched in a co-ordinated fashion in terms of time and location. Alongside coal-fired 
power plants, solar PV plus batteries will be an important source of flexibility and its 
prospects are improving rapidly (Box 3.2). 
Box 3.2 ? 	Solar PV plus batteries: More competitive than coal? 
Solar PV projects are now the cheapest source of new power generation in India, and 
are among the lowest cost in the world. However, an evaluation of the competitiveness 
of solar PV in India requires looking beyond the technology costs alone. Taking into 
account both costs and system value for available options is crucial for effective system 
planning.  
To differentiate sources of power generation not just according to their technology 
costs, but to their energy, flexibility and capacity value, the World Energy Outlook team 
has developed a metric called the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE) 
(IEA, 2018). This metric enables comparisons to be made between VRE and dispatchable 
thermal plants by simulating the behaviour of future power systems using a detailed 
hourly power model. The VALCOE does not, however, incorporate grid-related 
integration costs or environmental benefits such as reductions in air pollution that are 
not priced in markets; these costs and benefits may well be sizeable, and require 
separate consideration by policy makers. 
In recent years, new solar PV has become more competitive in India than new coal-fired 
power plants, and the VALCOE of solar PV is currently about 25% lower than that of new 
coal capacity. That gap is slightly narrower than the traditional LCOE would suggest: 
compared with coal, solar PV has a lower system value, principally because it makes 
smaller contributions to system adequacy and flexibility. Pairing short-duration battery 
storage with solar PV increases both the costs and the system value, making this option 
near competitive with coal-fired power (Figure 3.6). Although there is a wide variation 
in the costs of coal generation, solar PV is already competitive against some existing 
coalfired power plants with high variable costs or low thermal efficiencies. The fleet-
wide average variable cost, however, remains lower than new solar PV, and so 
displacing existing coal-fired power with new solar PV would in most cases not yet lower 
total electricity production costs or electricity prices to consumers. 
Other sources of supply- and demand-side flexibility 
Hydropower is the second-largest source of flexibility in India today with a total capacity of 
nearly 50 GW, mostly located at large reservoirs. Its ability to ramp up and down quickly 
was highlighted on 5 April 2020 when hydropower provided the majority of supply-side 
flexibility to accommodate the 10-minute Lights Out event in solidarity in the fight against 
Covid-19. There are also close to 5 GW of pumped hydro storage facilities in India, with 
significant potential for more that remains largely untapped to date due to regulatory and 
environmental constraints and to economic factors.  
Additional hydropower capacity will play an important part in expanding India's power 
system flexibility. Installed hydro capacity increases by about 50% to 2030 in the STEPS, and 
hydropower remains the second-largest flexibility source in India (Figure 3.7), but some 
challenges remain. Depending on the time of the year, hydropower becomes more or less 
important due to changing hydro flows. The highest hydro flows are in the monsoon 
season, while the lowest are generally in the winter. Both seasons can present operational 
difficulties, with excess and effectively must-run generation in monsoon months, and low 
generation in winter months. This seasonality can also have an impact on the 
complementarity of hydro with other renewable energy sources. For example, wind power 
is also at a maximum during the monsoon season, limiting the quality of the match with 
hydro in India.  
Figure 3.7 ? 	India hourly generation mix and annual share of flexibility by source 
in the STEPS 
 
Coal remains the main source of flexibility in India, but rising flexibility needs  
are met by a more diverse set of sources, including battery storage and DSR. 
 
Battery storage systems and DSR also look set to be essential parts of the flexibility 
portfolio. Battery storage systems are well-suited to the emerging need to shift solar PV 
output by several hours, from the middle of the day to evening peak demand, in order to 
better meet demand. By 2030, the STEPS sees nearly 35 GW of battery capacity. DSR, 
including the shifting of agricultural pumping and cooling loads, can likewise provide 
flexibility without compromising energy services to consumers by moving demand to times 
of the day with plentiful supply. Adapting regulation to permit the aggregation of loads 
could significantly expand DSR availability by enabling residential, agricultural, and smaller 
commercial and industrial customers to bring their DSR resources to a wide range of 
potential markets (IEA, 2018), especially since such smaller loads in buildings and 
agriculture represent the lion's share of DSR potential in India. Tariff design could also 
facilitate DSR uptake among electricity users; switching to time-of-use pricing, or perhaps 
even real-time pricing, would provide the necessary price signals to consumers to expand 
DSR from periodic load shedding in times of system stress to more regular load shifting 
(IEA, 2019). 
Figure 3.8 ? 	Average investment spending on electricity generation and networks 
in India in the STEPS, 2010-2030 
Capital expenditure on India's electricity networks is set to overtake that of generation,  with 
around 15% of spending on networks in 2030 used to connect new renewables. 
 
The transmission system has a crucial part to play in the efficient use of flexible resources 
over the next 10 years. The system integration of solar PV will require investment in storage 
and distribution networks to cope with the solar-driven "duck curve" in the morning and 
evening hours, while transmission and balancing capacity is required to manage wind 
power's strong seasonality. Better regional interconnections across India's regions are also 
critical, optimising power flows between states with differing demand and generation 
profiles. For example, northern parts of India have significant flexibility from hydropower 
but need to draw on imports during the early evening peak. Thermal plants in the eastern 
region, by contrast, provide flexibility for demand centres to the south and west, which 
have high industrial and agricultural loads and may call on imports during periods of low 
renewables availability.  
In the STEPS, spending on networks quickly overtakes spending on capacity growth, and 
investments in batteries start to take hold by the end of the decade, reflecting the way in 
which the current policy focus on achieving ambitious renewable energy targets is 
increasingly being complemented by a focus on the transformation of the power system 
(Figure 3.8). 
 
S P O T L I G H T
Insights from the state-level integration of renewables 
The share of solar and wind in India's 10 renewable-rich states is significantly higher 
than the national average, and these states are already redefining how their power 
systems are operated. The most significant renewables integration challenges are in 
Karnataka (where solar and wind meet around 30% of annual electricity demand), Tamil 
Nadu (19%) and Gujarat (13%) (Figure 3.9). These states are in Phase 3 of the IEA 
renewables integration framework, described above, and with ambitious targets they 
will move to Phase 4, putting them ahead of most countries.  

Several Indian states are leading the way in increasing the share of VRE in electricity 
demand, providing useful case studies for integration challenges. 
Note: Bubble size corresponds to percentage of electricity generated by VRE in each state relative to total 
electricity generation in India. 
The state of Gujarat is among the most advanced in its power market development, 
with significant renewables potential and robust deployment targets, financially stable 
discoms, and a statewide commitment to stop the commissioning of new coal projects 
from 2021. Gujarat is likely to face renewable integration challenges sooner than other 
states, and we have explored these challenges through a detailed Gujarat power system 
model. The model includes separate nodes for each of the discom areas as well as 
outof-state trade, and contrasts system operation today with the way it might look in 
2030 based on state government targets. 
Gujarat's 2030 targets include over 44 GW of solar and wind capacity to satisfy the state's 
power requirements, along with an additional 20 GW to be contracted to other states. 
These ambitions would increase the annual share of solar and wind generation to almost 
40% of total generation, from around 13% today. On an hourly basis, it is expected that 
solar and wind will meet up to 77% of demand at certain times of the day by 2022; by 
2030, output exceeds total demand in many hours of the year, posing significant system 
challenges and dramatically increasing the likelihood of curtailment (Figure 3.10).  

Renewables-rich states such as Gujarat are already coping with higher hourly shares 
than the rest of India, and are now facing future integration challenges. 
Today Gujarat still has negligible levels of solar and wind curtailment. However, without 
an increase in flexibility, 44 GW of solar and wind by 2030 would lead to annual 
curtailment of around 7% of solar and wind generation in 2030 - a significant level of 
lost output. Avoiding high levels of curtailment, and the additional system costs this 
may entail, will require action on a broad number of fronts. The results of our modelling 
exercise show that Gujarat is well-placed to develop three key flexibility resources: 
?	DSR: agricultural pumping accounts for more than 20% of the state's electricity 
demand, and shifting this load to the daytime would go some way towards aligning 
peak demand with solar output. This is achievable in Gujarat because it has a 
dedicated agricultural feeder system that allows the interruption of agricultural 
supply without impacting other consumers; this system is already used to manage 
the timing of agricultural supply today. Adjusting today's predominantly night-time 
scheduling to the day would reduce the baseline level of curtailment down to 3%, 
reduce the start-up needs from thermal generation sources by around 40%, and cut 
operating costs by around 10%.  
Thermal plant flexibility: coal power plants could be operated more flexibly if 
technical minimum plant load factors were to be reduced from 75% to 55% for older 

units and to 40% for newer units. The next decade will see a significant change to 
the operating practices of coal and gas plants: relatively minor changes in capacity 
factors will lead to much larger changes in the operating patterns of coal 
generators, which look set to spend more time at very high or very low output in 
2030 relative to today. More flexible operation of coal would allow the power 
system to cope with higher levels of renewables generation, but depends on the 
value of increased 
thermal plant flexibility being recognised and adequately compensated.  
 
Investment in batteries: a four-hour duration battery storage addition of 4 GW 
would allow high solar output during the day to be stored for later use to meet 
evening demand. As dispatchable thermal capacity declines relative to peak 
demand, battery storage would also help reduce short-term energy purchases and 
reduce import dependency. 
Operational and market design challenges 
As India adds a greater share of wind and solar to its energy mix and as its demand profile 
becomes more variable, it will face new kinds of operational and market-related challenges. 
This section explores the wider, structural features of India's power system and looks at 
where reforms could help India meet these challenges.  
India has one of the world's largest synchronous power grids, with most of the scheduling 
and unit commitment carried out at the intra-state level by discoms. Long-term bilateral 
PPAs are the main way of buying and selling electricity in India, covering 90% of generation 
in 2019. The remainder is either bilateral trading or transactions on India's power exchange. 
This means that generators, for the most part, are scheduled by discoms within a limited 
contractual pool. Hopes are high that India's power exchange will organise more efficient 
trades in the future, but liquidity is currently fragmented across different products and 
trading platforms, and the wholesale market currently accounts for less than 5% of all 
power transactions.  
India currently has 40 GW to 50 GW of generation capacity that is financially unviable. This 
is largely the result of a mismatch in demand and supply which has arisen because the pace 
of capacity additions has far exceeded demand growth. There is also a mismatch in 
incentives between generators which develop government- or state-auctioned capacity 
under attractive payment guarantees, and the discoms that are the primary off-takers for 
this new capacity. Both face difficulties in fulfilling their roles. Discoms struggle to collect 
revenue from consumers and face low regulated tariffs (often below the cost of metering), 
while generators have been unable to sell excess power to the relatively small wholesale 
market. The result of all this is renewable energy curtailment, asset underperformance, a 
general mismatch between the costs of producing electricity and the available returns, and 
a high level of technical and commercial losses, which average around 20% (compared with 
a global average of 7%). 
The Indian power system also has a history of outages, resulting in part from the difficulties 
faced by the discoms discussed above, which have constrained investment in infrastructure 
and contributed to the current high level of technical losses. This history has led many 
consumers to install diesel-fired back-up power, and encouraged larger-scale industrial 
users to opt out of buying higher-priced grid electricity. 
These are well-recognised issues, and the Indian government is pursuing a number of 
reforms. A key objective is a centralised market for day-ahead scheduling and real-time 
dispatch with gate closure. There were several developments in 2020: in June, the real-time 
power market was launched, filling an important gap by providing real-time corrections for 
intermittent and variable generation such as solar and wind, as well as for demand. This 
was followed by the launch of the Green Term-Ahead Market, allowing renewable 
electricity to be traded at a premium (compared with the regular day-ahead market) for 
buyers looking to fulfil their renewables purchase obligations (RPOs).  
Further regional and, eventually, countrywide integration of the power system is crucial to 
managing the growing share of renewables. Co-ordination between a strong federal 
structure and supporting states is a central component of system integration, especially 
since India's power system has a diversified ownership structure, which means that 
reconciling different interests is a key part of effective regulation and governance. Greater 
integration and co-ordination are key objectives in the roll-out of renewable management 
centres and "green energy corridors" across eight renewable-rich states in order to 
facilitate the transmission of solar and wind to high demand centres. 
However, there are several aspects that require further development. The necessary 
network upgrades rely on the ability of consumers to pay fixed charges and on grid 
companies to pay for bottleneck management services. Market liberalisation is hindered by 
a general unwillingness by generators to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts and 
submit to market-based pricing. Moreover, the business model for utility-scale battery 
storage in India remains uncertain, in the absence of efficient price signals that would 
enable batteries to arbitrage between periods of scarce and abundant supply. Far-reaching 
electricity sector reform would be needed to accommodate the scale of battery 
deployment required in WEO scenarios. 
Sensitivity cases were run to explore the implications of slower progress on market reforms 
and rates of deployment of flexibility resources. In the first sensitivity, India is prevented 
from fully leveraging its thermal plant flexibility: in this case, there is a continued restriction 
on older coal plants to maintain a minimum stable operating level of 75% instead of 55%, 
while new coal plants operate at a minimum of 50%, rather than at 45%. Sensitivities were 
also run on batteries and DSR, assuming that no further investments would be made in 
these sources of flexibility after 2020. 
 
 
Reduced flexibility from batteries, thermal power plants or demand response  in 2030 
would lead to increased renewables curtailment and additional operating costs. 
 
A lack of development in any of these three flexibility options would result in increased 
renewables curtailment and in increased operating costs relative to STEPS; this is 
particularly the case for batteries, which play a strong role in integrating the increasing 
share of solar generation (Figure 3.11). However, further cost-benefit analysis would be 
required to determine whether the value of curtailed renewable energy would exceed the 
investments required to reduce their curtailment. 
Box 3.3 ? 	How cheap is India's electricity?  
Electricity prices in India in nominal terms are lower than the average among member 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
However, after adjusting for purchasing power, so as to reflect spending on electricity 
as a share of Indian household income, prices are higher than the OECD average. This is 
despite the fact that India - like some other emerging and developing economies - has 
higher end-user prices for more energy-intensive industrial consumers in order to 
crosssubsidise the lower tariffs paid by vulnerable users in the household and 
agricultural segment. Prices also vary not just among end users, but also between 
states, where a complex patchwork of different taxes and subsidy regimes can leave 
consumers in some states paying five times more for their electricity than their 
counterparts in neighbouring states (Figure 3.12). 

Households' electricity tariffs in India are higher than the OECD average, adjusted for purchasing 
power, despite being subsidised by commercial and industrial consumers. 
Note: End-user prices (stacked by state) calculate each state's discom revenue per megawatt-hour for each 
category of consumer.  
The degree to which electricity becomes affordable is primarily a consequence of 
macroeconomic conditions, particularly the purchasing power of wages and the level of 
wage growth, but there are also issues endemic to the power sector that create 
additional challenges, such as high levels of technical and commercial losses and poor 
billing practices and collection rates. Tariffs sometimes end up four times higher than 
the purchase cost of power, and some low-income households pay a significant portion 
of their monthly income to meet electricity bills.  
Looking ahead, the rise of renewables is likely to add to the complexity of electricity 
tariffs because it is likely to lead to billing based on the time of use becoming a more 
important part of cost-effective system balancing. There is already a case for ensuring 
that the complex and varied tariffs in place do not disadvantage low-income 
households, and this further projected increase in the variation in tariffs adds to it.  
3.2.3 	The power system in the India Vision Case and  Sustainable Development 
Scenario: Charging ahead 
The IVC shows a smarter transformation of the electricity sector that more fully exploits the 
flexibility from thermal power plants, as well as storage, DSR and cross-sector integration, 
in order to accommodate rising shares of renewable energy. There is also a notable shift to 
an India-wide, cost-reflective dispatch of generation assets. Timely implementation of 
market reforms underpins a significant scaling up of investment, as electricity demand is 
nearly 10% higher in 2030 compared with the STEPS. 
The power system of the IVC makes the transition to renewables and away from coal at a 
faster pace than in the STEPS. By 2030, renewables make up around 60% of total 
generation capacity and provide 450 GW of non-hydro renewable capacity. Utility-scale 
solar PV passes the 60 GW mark in 2022, while close to 30 GW of agricultural load is met by 
solar in the next five years. By 2030, solar PV alone is responsible for meeting 75% of India's 
2030 renewable target, and is on track to provide almost 800 GW in 2040. Offshore wind 
deployment also accelerates in the IVC, with the industry gaining a foothold in the 2020s 
and capacity eventually expanding to 30 GW in 2040 (Figure 3.13). 
Figure 3.13 ? Power capacity in India by source in the SDS and IVC, 2000-2040 
 
The ramp-up in renewable capacity in the IVC is almost as rapid as in the SDS. 
 
The development of battery storage systems in India also picks up in the IVC, with greater 
deployment and deeper cost reductions: at $120/kWh, the cost of a four-hour storage 
system is 40% lower than in the STEPS in 2040. Batteries are an essential means to 
integrate additional solar and wind capacity in this case, and reach almost 200 GW of 
capacity in 2040, 36% higher than in the STEPS. The expansion of battery capacity also 
serves to limit the amount of coal-fired capacity needed to ensure power system adequacy. 
The IVC sees in addition a lifting of many of the barriers to DSR: aggregation of loads and 
access to wholesale and balancing markets for demand-side resources allows DSR to 
mitigate the increase in peak demand in the IVC, and to facilitate the integration of higher 
shares of solar PV. Agricultural pumping sees a major transition to solar PV powered 
pumping solutions, and remaining gridconnected pumping is aligned with power-system 
needs in the IVC thanks to tariff design and smart controls. Meanwhile more of India's 
rapidly growing fleet of air conditioners are equipped with smart controls in the IVC, 
allowing for modulation of electricity demand in line with system flexibility needs. 
On the thermal side, captive coal generation capacity is gradually replaced by gas-fired and 
(to a lesser extent) renewables capacity. Coal-fired capacity peaks in the mid-2020s and 
then declines steadily. This leads to improvements in air quality in cities in India, while also 
cutting energy-related CO2 emissions. The emphasis on gas-fired power also gives a boost 
to the overall use of natural gas in India.  
Overall, the IVC gets India's power system much closer to the trajectory required in the SDS, 
where renewable capacity additions reach 1 330 GW by 2040 (compared with 1 200 GW in 
the IVC). However, emissions outcomes remain far apart: in the SDS, total power sector 
emissions fall by 80% compared with 2019 levels by 2040, and are on course to reach net 
zero by 2050, whereas in the IVC they remain largely unchanged. This difference is primarily 
a consequence of existing coal-fired capacity continuing to play a relatively prominent role 
in India's power system in the IVC, where the rapid growth in renewables avoids new 
emissions from rising electricity demand but does not displace existing coal-fired capacity. 
In the SDS, by contrast, a wide range of technologies and measures are deployed to reduce 
emissions from existing coal assets that would otherwise continue to operate, as in the IVC. 
They include, for example, measures to reduce the amount of output from existing coal-
fired power plants by repurposing them to focus on providing flexibility, by equipping 
existing plants with CCUS or co-firing with biomass, or by retiring them early if these 
options are not viable (section 3.4.2). 
3.3 	Exploring prospects for a gas-based economy 
India has long-standing plans to expand the use of gas in its energy mix, and the level of 
current ambition is high: the government is targeting a 15% share of gas in the energy mix 
by 2030, up from 6% today and 8% in 2010. Achieving this ambition would still leave the 
share of gas below today's global average of 23%, but this shift would nonetheless be a 
momentous one for the Indian energy economy. It would require significant investment 
and policy support all the way along the value chain to incentivise new upstream activity 
and gas import capacity, to underpin the construction of new transmission and distribution 
pipelines, and to install new end-user equipment.  
There are reasons to believe that the gas market can grow rapidly, provided that current 
policies promoting its use are effectively implemented. International gas market conditions 
are propitious for India: ample supply at low prices helped to avoid a reduction in gas 
demand in 2020 despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and is now giving price-
sensitive Indian buyers incentives to contract new volumes. Efforts are also under way to 
enact market reforms that encourage gas trading, and to rationalise the taxes and tariffs 
applied to different end users across the states of India.  
Nonetheless, significant challenges lie ahead. India's gas market today is a complex 
patchwork of different pricing mechanisms, gas allocation schemes and types of gas (Box 
3.4), and there are some distressed gas-fired assets in the power sector as well as some 
underperforming and underutilised infrastructure. This complexity represents one 
challenge. It will also not be easy to encourage growth in a market that is likely to be based, 
in large part, on imported gas, or to find ways of overcoming the persistent 
competitiveness gap at the end-use level between gas and cheaper local energy sources 
such as coal and renewables. Ultimately, concerted policy efforts, backed by robust 
implementation, are key to creating the incentives necessary for gas in India to grow. 
Box 3.4 ? 	A gas by any other name 
Gas has multiple identities in India, with different terms used to distinguish its origin or 
end use. Pipeline natural gas, or PNG, mostly consists of domestically produced natural 
gas. Imported gas is known as r-LNG, or regasified liquefied natural gas. CNG, or 
compressed natural gas, is natural gas that is bottled and sold at filling stations as a 
transport fuel. Biomethane, which is biogas upgraded to reach pipeline quality 
specifications, is a relatively new addition to the gas lexicon, and is being marketed in 
India as a sustainable variant of CNG, called either CBG or bio-CNG.  
All of the above gases are ultimately methane, the primary constituent of natural gas. 
The exception is biogas, which also consists of CO2 and other gases such as nitrogen, 
and when not upgraded to biomethane is used primarily as a source of local heat and 
power and clean cooking in rural areas. Although often assumed to be in the same 
category as these gases, liquefied petroleum gas - LPG - is a natural gas liquid and in 
IEA accounting is classified as a liquid fuel. 
The prospect of increased Indian reliance on natural gas provokes a range of views as to the 
implications for India's economy, its environmental performance and its energy security. 
Our intention in this section is to untangle these various strands and explore in more detail 
what a gas-based economy could mean for India, and the extent to which it might meet 
India's designated policy objectives - notably to diversify the fuel mix towards cleaner 
alternatives, tackle poor urban air quality and reduce dependence on oil.  
3.3.1 	Can India afford gas? 
The prospects for gas in India hinge on its affordability, and whether there is a way to 
adequately remunerate gas producers and suppliers while still having a delivered product 
that is consistently and affordably priced for Indian consumers. There are parts of India, 
notably in Gujarat, that have been relatively successful in finding this balance, but the 
overall record - despite numerous reforms and administrative solutions - has been mixed. 
There is also a very wide variation across different Indian states in terms of today's gas 
infrastructure and consumption (Table 3.3), although there are ambitious plans to expand 
pipeline connections and CNG filling stations almost everywhere. 
Table 3.3 ? 	Indicators of gas supply, consumption and infrastructure in selected 
states and union territories of India, 2019 
  

Wholesale gas pricing 
On the wholesale side, pricing is split between domestically produced gas and more costly 
LNG imports (Figure 3.14). Since 2014, the price of domestically produced gas has been set 
by a formula linked to a basket of international reference prices. This means it is not 
necessarily reflective of the cost to producers of domestic extraction, nor the affordability - 
or willingness to pay - of gas to different consumer categories in India. In 2019, this 
administered price averaged $3.2/MBtu,  while the weighted average wholesale price of 
all sources of gas in India in 2019 was around $6/MBtu once more expensive imports were 
factored in.  
Around half of India's gas supply is imported and, with around 30 bcm of LNG imports in 
2019, India is already the world's fourth-largest importer of LNG. The majority of LNG 
delivered in 2019 was priced either via oil-linked formulas, typically at a premium of 11-15% 
to crude oil markers, such as Brent or the Japanese Crude Cocktail (JCC), or as hub-indexed 
spot US LNG delivered under long-term contracts. The remainder was purchased on the 
spot market, where prices are often determined on the basis of gas-to-gas competition. In 
recent years, these spot prices have been well below the cost of oil-indexed gas supply, 
resulting in pressure from the main Indian buyers of LNG - Petronet and GAIL - to 
renegotiate the terms of these long-term supply contracts. In parallel, the practice of 
tendering for spot LNG cargoes has strengthened price discovery, which has been bolstered 
by the creation of the IGX, India's nascent gas market hub. This allows buyers and sellers to 
trade in both spot and forward contracts across three physical hubs (Box 3.5). 
Figure 3.14 ? Weighted average cost of natural gas in India by source, 2019 
 
A significant cost gap exists between domestically produced gas, which has been unable 
to keep pace with demand, and imported LNG, the price of which is mostly linked to oil. 
 
Notes: Domestic costs refer to the break-even costs of developing resources. LNG imports refer to landed 
costs. 

India took an important step in its gas market evolution in June 2020 with the opening 
of the IGX. This is a digital trading platform linking three physical LNG-importing "hubs": 
Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. For the moment, only 
regasified LNG is tradeable, but over time this platform could become a way to 
introduce more transparent, cost-reflective and uniform pricing arrangements across 
the entire Indian gas market. 
To become a successful reference point for price, a trading hub requires a number of 
enabling conditions, notably an unbundled gas value chain with third-party access to 
infrastructure and the presence of several buyers and sellers of wholesale gas. It also 
needs a certain amount of liquidity, meaning that gas might be bought and sold multiple 
times before being physically delivered and consumed. It must also have depth, 
meaning that gas has to be available on spot terms, e.g. on a day-ahead basis, and as a 
futures product, e.g. deliveries agreed for the next month, season or year. Market 
participants can use these traded products to undertake risk management, for example 
by hedging their future production or consumption.  
These conditions are not yet met in India. As in many other emerging gas markets, there 
is only a limited set of gas supply sources in India, while infrastructure (including 
storage) is still insufficient, and domestic supply is dominated by long-term bilateral 
contracts, often with strict conditions about delivery and resale. Unbundling the gas 
value chain, ensuring transparent third-party access and bringing greater competitive 
pressures to bear on the Indian gas market (thereby curbing the market power of 
incumbents) is a process that is likely to take time. The most well-known gas hubs in the 
United States (Henry Hub) and in Europe (the National Balancing Point [NBP] in the 
United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility [TTF] in the Netherlands) all took several 
years after their inception to reach maturity. The Indian power sector provides a further 
useful point of comparison: an exchange was created in 2008, and has since seen 
significant growth in the number of transactions, but the current traded volume still 
represents only 5% of total power supplied in the country.  
End-user prices 
There are a multitude of gas prices in India, which vary depending on the origin of the gas, 
the distance it travels and the taxes applicable in the state in which it is consumed. An 
important factor determining the end-use price of natural gas is the mix between domestic 
gas and imported LNG. A government-administered allocation policy reserves the cheaper 
domestically produced volumes of gas for specific consumer categories (Figure 3.15). The 
order of allocation has undergone frequent revisions over the past several years; power 
plants, until recently a high priority, have now been removed from the list altogether. 
Fertiliser plants were also initially given preferential access to reduce the need for more 
expensive urea imports. However, later revisions gave city gas distribution (CGD) top billing 
to free up LPG for use in rural areas in place of more polluting fuels, while fertiliser plants 
transitioned to a "pooled pricing" system to help them to manage the transition to greater 
imports.  
Figure 3.15 ? Split of domestically produced gas and LNG consumed by sector, 
2019 
 
The power sector has received the highest share of cheaper domestically produced gas in 
recent years, although the most recent rule changes now prioritise CGD. 
 
Notes: IEA analysis based on PPAC (2020). 
Commentary about the affordability of gas on India's gas market typically focuses on the 
sensitivity of consumption to landed LNG costs; a recurring narrative is that LNG prices lying 
above a $5/MBtu to $6/MBtu range preclude the large-scale adoption of gas in the face of 
competing fuels. However, pipeline tariffs and taxes are very important elements in the 
final cost to consumers, and they vary widely in a complex patchwork across the country, 
depending on the category of consumer and the state in which they reside.  In the case of 
India, tariff reform and a streamlining of applicable taxes are important policy levers that 
could potentially reduce the prices charged to end consumers and therefore make higher 
imported gas prices more tolerable.  
For this report, we conducted a bottom-up analysis of prices actually paid by different end 
users, using facility and state-level data in key gas-consuming industries and states. This has 
yielded a first-of-a-kind estimate of the range of prices paid in different states and sectors 
in India, making possible a more detailed assessment of the competitiveness of gas 
compared with competing fuels (Figure 3.16).  

There is an affordability gap between natural gas and competing fuels in several sectors, 
although a small subset of consumers benefit from access to lower-cost domestic gas. 
 
Notes: Mm3 = million cubic metres. Energy sector own use not included. Many industries are not viable for 
competitive fuel switching, e.g. a relatively small amount of gas is used as process heat in the petrochemicals 
sector, while 90% of fertiliser production already comes from natural gas. Competing fuels are naphtha and, 
potentially, coal gasification. 

As noted above, the weighted average price of domestic and imported gas in India in 2019 
was around $6/MBtu. With the additions of different state taxes, transport tariffs and 
corporate margins, the final cost to consumers is usually considerably higher, however, and 
the weighted average end user price in 2019 was $12/MBtu. The range is very large, with 
most gas consumers paying somewhere between $6/MBtu and $18/MBtu. This is 
comparable in absolute terms to prices paid in Europe, but is much higher after adjusting 
for relative purchasing power in India. A further difference between end-user prices in India 
and elsewhere is that most large-scale users of gas in India, such as industrial facilities, pay 
higher prices than smaller-scale consumers.  
As things stand, the main sector where gas is clearly competitive is transport; CNG prices 
are around 40-50% lower than petrol and diesel prices, which also have a high tax 
component. Natural gas is also well placed to compete in smaller-scale industries that 
require consistent levels of adjustable process heat but must, suboptimally, resort to using 
coal, biomass or furnace oil today. However, in many other parts of the Indian economy - 
including some key industrial sectors - the case for gas on straight cost grounds is much less 
compelling. With today's regulatory framework, economics alone do not make the case for 
gas in India. 
Gas demand in the STEPS 
 
Industry is the key driver of natural gas demand growth, while transport demand underpins 
the growth of biomethane, which reaches a 10% share of total gas demand by 2040.  
 
Overcoming affordability challenges for natural gas requires a range of supportive policies. 
The Indian government, as well as some states, has put in place a number of policies 
promoting gas use, including a wide-scale roll-out of CNG and bio-CNG, and the expansion 
of gas infrastructure including LNG terminals, long-distance transmission pipelines and CGD 
networks. These policy ambitions translate into rapid growth of gas demand in the STEPS 
over the next decade (Figure 3.17). On average, gas grows nearly 7% each year to 2030, 
more than double the rate of overall energy demand growth. The share of gas in India's 
energy mix (both natural gas and biomethane) doubles from 6% to 12% by 2040, largely at 
the expense of coal and traditional solid biomass. However, this share remains the lowest 
among the countries and regions modelled in the WEO.  
Gas use in industry  
In the STEPS, industrial gas demand - including the use of gas as a feedstock for 
petrochemical and fertiliser production - is the primary source of demand growth (Figure 
3.18), and the share of gas in total industry energy demand nearly doubles to reach 20% by 
2040. Most of the growth comes from lighter industrial sectors and small- and medium-
scale industrial customers, who gain gas connections as transmission and distribution 
infrastructure is rolled out. This means that the share in industrial gas demand of energy-
intensive industries such as refineries, fertiliser plants and some gas-based steel producers 
declines from around 40% today to around a fifth in 2040. 
 
Industrial gas demand is poised to rise rapidly, with infrastructure supporting  market 
growth and encouraging existing end users to switch away from other fuels. 
 
Gas, where it is available, is well suited to the needs of lighter industrial sectors such as 
textiles, manufacturing, and food and beverages. These tend to be located in or close to 
large population centres, where air quality becomes an increasingly important 
consideration; providing policy incentives for such clusters of MSMEs to switch to gas-
burning equipment is therefore key to unlocking further growth. For many such industries, 
the convenience of being able to adjust process heat temperatures and the opportunity to 
make efficiency gains are added advantages of using gas instead of liquid or solid fuels, 
although electricity provides competition for some lower-heat applications. For some 
industries currently using liquid fuels, switching to gas can be commercially attractive, 
particularly in cases where fuel costs are relatively low in terms of total added value, or 
where there is a relatively short payback period associated with the upfront investment 
costs to switch to gas-burning equipment. 
Policies will play a critical role in determining the speed and scope of growth in natural gas. 
Most of the 30 bcm of demand growth attributable to fuel switching in the STEPS is driven 
by policy-led efforts to reduce the level of coal and oil use in industries which are located 
near urban areas and contribute to poor air quality. To take one example, the possibility of 
using CNG in place of coal in India's massive brick industry is attracting interest in some 
jurisdictions. 
Gas use in power  
Natural gas has been facing a perfect storm in India's power sector in recent years. A wave 
of new power plants was commissioned in the late 2000s in anticipation of a large increase 
in supply from India's offshore gas resources. However, production from the much-awaited 
KG-D6 field in the Krishna Godavari Basin off India's east coast did not match expectations 
and fell away quickly. Gas-fired power plants were left short of gas or became reliant on 
more expensive LNG. The situation was compounded by revisions to the gas allocation 
policy, which left power plants lower on the priority list. Lower-than-anticipated electricity 
demand, along with ample thermal coal capacity, has meanwhile left very little space for 
gas to contribute to marginal power generation. In 2018, 60% of gas-fired power plants 
were deemed by the government to have become stranded assets (Ministry of Power, 
2018). 
Recent market developments have seen mixed fortunes for gas; LNG spot prices in summer 
2020 hit record lows of around $2/MBtu, causing an uptick in gas used for power 
generation. However, a tighter Asian market caused spot prices in December 2020 to surge 
to multi-year highs, dampening the economics of gas plants. Moreover, supply-side 
economics are only one determinant of a plant's operations; actual scheduling depends 
foremost on the level of electricity demand, while the electricity tariffs received by gas are 
fixed by long-term PPAs, with dispatch determined within a limited contractual pool of 
generators. Even if this were to change, less than a third of capacity would be competitive 
at tariffs below $30/MWh (Figure 3.19), given the level of gas import prices reached in WEO 
scenarios ($7/MBtu to $9/MBtu). With cheap solar providing the main competition for the 
incumbent coal-fired generators, natural gas is looking at a range of walk-on parts in India's 
power scene rather than a central role. 
With plant economics likely to remain challenging, the outlook for gas in India's power 
sector - as elsewhere - is highly contingent on policy, and on the implications of policy for 
coalfired power. Ideas that have been explored to revive stranded gas plants include the 
possibility of pooling tariffs from gas-based power plants with those of renewable facilities 
in order to enhance their affordability for consumers. Reforms in the midstream, such as 
allowing power plants to contract pipeline capacity on a more flexible basis, could reduce 
operational costs. Using natural gas plants to provide flexibility, and then remunerating 
their ancillary services to the electricity grid, is another possible option. However, for the 
moment, most of the tariffs do not reflect the additional costs of meeting peak demand and 
operating only when renewable energy generation is at seasonal or diurnal lows, and some 
cash-poor discoms have been reluctant to dispatch relatively expensive gas even when it is 
required for system reliability.  
 
Notes: Right-hand chart is IEA analysis based on Ministry of Power (2020), covering the period March-August 
2020, during which spot gas prices were at record lows. Other refers to generation sources covered by 
Ministry of Power reporting, primarily thermal coal plants. The delivered cost of gas in the left-hand chart 
includes the energy component (50-60%) and taxes, tariffs and corporate margins (40-50%).  
As discussed in the deep dive on the power sector above, India has an increasing need for 
flexibility, and this creates some opportunities for natural gas in the future. However, most 
of India's flexibility needs are relatively short term, even intraday, and these are areas 
where gas faces some fierce competition from other technology options. Recent auctions 
for roundthe-clock power have primarily been won by renewables linked to utility-scale 
batteries. In the STEPS, coal plants are the major source of flexibility to balance the growing 
share of VRE to 2030. In later years gas is used alongside a broad range of other flexibility 
options, including greater interconnections, battery storage and DSR.  
As a result of the difficult environment it faces in the fast-growing power generation sector, 
only around 10% of additional gas demand to 2040 comes from that sector in the STEPS. 
Most of that increase over the next decade is due to a revival of existing gas power plants 
rather than investment in new plant capacity (Figure 3.20). Despite the increase, moreover, 
the contribution of gas to overall power generation remains static, at around 4%, as solar 
and wind make up the majority of new generation.  

India's gas-based power assets slowly recover from today's low utilisation rates; capacity 
growth after 2030 is underpinned by flexibility rather than baseload requirements. 
 
One opportunity for new gas-fired power generation is in the captive power sector, i.e. with 
companies that choose to generate their own power or use diesel as back-up generators. 
This is a significant element in the Indian power mix, accounting for around 40% of 
industrial power needs. At present, more than half of India's 75 GW of installed captive 
capacity is coalfired, followed by diesel generators with a 20% share. Gas has a 10% share 
of the captive power sector, and around a quarter of gas-fired generation in 2019 was from 
captive power units, with petrochemical and fertiliser plants the main users. The scope for 
growth is linked to two main variables: the roll-out of gas infrastructure and the reliability 
and affordability of electricity from the centralised grid. We estimate that 1.5 bcm to 4.5 
bcm of additional gas demand could arise in the captive power segment, with the upper 
range depending on industries with existing captive capacity deciding to switch their 
generation to gas.  
City gas distribution 
CGD is a category encompassing a number of different uses - gas for residential cooking 
and hot water, CNG for transport, and a wide variety of commercial and small-scale 
industrial uses. The rise in gas use in urban households over the last decade has largely 
been policydriven, underpinned by efforts to free up LPG for use in rural areas. As of 
September 2018, 18 states and union territories (covering 96 cities, towns and districts) in 
India had city gas networks, with the majority of residential gas demand consumed in the 
urban agglomerations of Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.  
In the transport sector, India is one of the largest CNG markets in the world, with nearly 3 
million CNG vehicles and half a million CNG buses on the roads. There are ambitious plans 
to expand the use of biomethane in transport, with targets to add bio-CNG cylinders to the 
product line of 5 000 CNG stations by 2025. There are also emerging plans to develop LNG 
as a heavy-duty transport fuel. This degree of policy ambition translates into an average 
growth rate of nearly 6% in the STEPS; by 2040, around 5% of total gas demand is used in 
road transport, more than double the global average. 
The uptake of gas by more urban consumers depends on the development of gas 
infrastructure, especially distribution pipelines and CNG stations. A total of 10 bidding 
rounds have taken place that awarded tenders to build gas distribution networks, but the 
scale of the 9th (in 2018) and 10th (in 2019) bidding rounds underlined India's ambitions to 
extend the gas grid. If all the proposed infrastructure were to be built, this would give 
potential coverage to 70% of India's population, compared with 2% who are connected 
today (around 5 million households). GAIL, the main transmission system operator in India, 
is expanding its gas transmission network by around 80% over the next three years to 
develop a backbone for this roll-out of distribution infrastructure (PNGRB, 2020). The main 
trunk line under construction is the Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline, nearly 4 
000 km in length, to bring gas to the eastern and northeastern parts of the country. There 
are also plans to develop small-scale LNG supply chains, loading them onto specialised 
containers for transport through road, rail and barge networks, prior to developing pipeline 
infrastructure. 
A host of permitting and financing challenges remain before these plans can be realised. 
Moreover, the ambition to scale up urban gas consumption is significantly greater than the 
projected rise in domestic output, so although the CGD sector as a whole stands to benefit 
from priority access to cheaper domestic gas resources, it also faces the prospect of 
increased reliance on imported sources of gas. As the balance of domestic and LNG 
consumed in CGD tilts towards the latter, prices are likely to increase. The extent to which 
this might be matched by rising household incomes and industry margins is a key 
uncertainty. 
The affordability of gas also hinges on efforts to reform gas transport tariffs in order to 
prevent consumers farther away from gas sources from being penalised (while avoiding 
problems with CGD utilities' cost recovery of the kind experienced by electricity distribution 
companies in the electricity sector). Unbundling supply from transport and ensuring 
thirdparty access are crucial prerequisites for the cost-effective utilisation of the grid. The 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board has recently enacted a series of supportive 
regulatory actions aimed at rolling out a uniform transmission tariff, standardising gas 
purchase agreements and launching an electronic bulletin board. 
In the absence of significant winter heating loads, the quantity of gas demanded by CGD 
consumers does not vary much over the course of the year; seasonal variation is of the 
order of 10%, compared with over 250% in Northwest Europe. This limits the need to 
oversize parts of the system, including storage, meaning the marginal investment costs per 
household connection are relatively lower.  
Aggregate demand in the CGD sector is likely to be far lower than in the power generation 
and industrial sectors, where bulk quantities are contracted by power plants and large-scale 
industrial users, many of which are directly connected to the high-volume transmission 
network. As a result, the business model underpinning the expansion of gas distribution 
networks relies less on securing a few big anchor customers than on building pipelines in 
conjunction with CNG stations, which are currently the most profitable end users.  
3.3.3 	Gas supply and security in the STEPS 
A key uncertainty in India's movement towards a "gas-based economy" is whether it can 
take place without a vibrant upstream gas sector. Gas production has fallen since reaching a 
high point in 2010, and has flattened out at around 32 bcm in recent years. Lower-than-
expected domestic production has had several knock-on effects on India's energy sector as 
a whole, leaving distressed assets in the power sector, increasing the cost of fertiliser 
subsidies, and reshaping the market distortions that stem from the complex allocation 
regime of cheap domestic gas. The government wants to revitalise investment in India's 
own gas resources, but the pandemic and its aftermath weigh heavily on prospects for a 
durable recovery in regional gas prices, particularly as the LNG market appears well-
supplied over the next five years; while this is good news for Indian importers, it does not 
bode well for the government's ambitions for domestic gas production. 
Estimates of India's recoverable gas resources stand at around 8 trillion cubic metres (tcm), 
the majority of which are situated in India's eastern offshore block, Krishna Godavari. The 
Indian government has taken steps to incentivise development of technically challenging 
natural gas fields, including deepwater resources, by reforming licensing requirements and 
allowing companies to market the resulting production at higher prices. This has spurred 
some new offshore developments by ONGC and Reliance, as well as some spending on 
smaller fields onshore. The government is also looking to encourage production of coalbed 
methane, where resources are estimated at some 1.2 tcm and current production is around 
1.3 bcm per year. India also has some potential for shale gas, although challenges related to 
land and water access make large-scale production unlikely.  
The major dilemma facing the Indian upstream is the flip side of the "affordability" issue 
discussed above: prices on the domestic market are at present not adequate to trigger 
larger investment, especially at a time when company finances are under strain from the 
pandemic and when there is ample supply of international LNG. In the STEPS, however, the 
market begins to rebalance in the mid-2020s; domestic natural gas production gradually 
picks up as prices rise and a hospitable regulatory framework supports additional 
investment in new offshore fields, and overall output more than doubles to reach 78 bcm 
by 2040 (Figure 3.21).  
An additional, sometimes overlooked, source of domestic gas supply for India is 
biomethane. India has ample supplies of sustainable feedstock for biogas and biomethane 
production, mainly from sugar cane, rice and wheat crop residues. Increased urbanisation 
and improvements in waste management and collection also create significant potential for 
gas production from municipal solid waste. In an environment where most natural gas is 
imported, and long-distance pipelines face difficulties with permitting and financing, these 
local sources of domestic supply represent a potentially attractive option from both a 
commercial and an environmental perspective. Biomethane production, primarily for use in 
the transport sector, reaches nearly 20 bcm by 2040 in the STEPS (see section 3.4.2). 
Figure 3.21 ? Domestic gas production in India in the STEPS, 2010-2040 
 
A revival in offshore gas fields over the next decade helps bring production back to its 
historic 2010 peak; unconventional gas and biomethane lead growth in the 2030s. 
 
The growing gap between India's domestic output and its projected demand means an 
increasing reliance on imports. In the STEPS, these are met entirely by LNG; we do not 
assume any new pipeline connections over the period to 2040. Although the economics 
could work, the practical and political challenges of bringing gas to India overland from Iran 
or from Turkmenistan weigh heavily against these options, especially in an environment 
where LNG is readily available for direct delivery to Indian ports.  
As noted above, India is already a major LNG importer and has several long-term gas 
contracts in place for around 35 bcm per year of deliveries. The largest source of LNG for 
the Indian market is Qatar, although its share of the total has declined in recent years as 
Indian buyers have contracted shipments from a more diverse set of exporters. In 2019, 
these included African exporters (Nigeria and Angola), other Middle Eastern countries 
(United Arab Emirates and Oman), the United States and Australia. The range of potential 
sources of LNG and the increasing flexibility of contractual terms provide some comfort in 
terms of gas security, although India does face the prospect of a rising bill over time for 
imported gas.  
In the STEPS, India sees a quadrupling of LNG imports from around 30 bcm in 2019 to more 
than 120 bcm in 2040, and continues to source LNG from a range of international suppliers 
(Figure 3.22). The annual cost of imported gas rises from $12 billion to $43 billion over this 
period, though this remains relatively small compared with the cost of imported oil ($250 
billion in 2040).  
Figure 3.22 ? Indian LNG imports by exporting region in the STEPS, 2019-2040 
 
 
India is a primary market for LNG, accounting for nearly 30% of global growth to 2040 in the 
STEPS, and is well positioned geographically to develop a balanced portfolio of supply. 
 
Rising LNG imports in the STEPS means that the gap between already-contracted LNG 
supply and projected LNG demand widens to around 40 bcm by 2030. We assume that this 
is filled with a mixed portfolio of fixed-term contracts and spot volumes. This does not, as is 
sometimes assumed, imply a choice between long-term, inflexible, oil-indexed supply and 
market-responsive spot purchases. While it is true that long-term contracts have "take-
orpay" clauses that oblige buyers to import a minimum contracted quantity of gas, there 
are several provisions allowing for flexibility. For example, in 2018 GAIL exercised its right to 
resell US LNG volumes that were uncompetitive in the Indian market by agreeing "swap 
contracts" with Shell. Moreover, volumes agreed in long-term contracts need not 
necessarily be oil-indexed, and in recent years sellers have accepted a variety of pricing 
terms, agreeing to reduced "slopes" dictating the strength of the oil-gas price link, netback 
to Henry Hub prices or linkages to emerging Asian spot benchmarks. Contracting a spot 
cargo, by contrast, is by definition "take-or-pay", and short-term contracts underpinning 
spot deliveries can still be indexed to oil. India's need for reliable baseload supplies of LNG 
implies that long-term contracts will remain part of the mix, even as the country seeks to 
benefit from the growing commoditisation of LNG. 
3.3.4 	Realising the India vision for gas in 2030 
The outcomes in the STEPS move India towards the government's aim of becoming a much 
more gas-based economy, but do not meet its aspirations in full. We explore the additional 
upside potential for gas in the IVC, in which gas achieves an 11% share in the overall energy 
mix by 2030 (compared with 9% by the same year in the STEPS). In the IVC, gas use grows at 
an average annual rate of 8% to 2030, or around eight times the average rate of growth 
over the last decade. All sectors share in this additional growth, with around 40% coming 
from industry, especially manufacturing, steel and petrochemicals, and half from the power 
sector. CNG is also more widely used as a transport fuel (Figure 3.23). 
Figure 3.23 ? Growth in key indicators for gas in India in the STEPS compared with 
the IVC, 2019-2030 
 
The IVC sees a more than doubling of gas demand in the next decade,  
sustained by market reforms and policy support. 
 
The IVC is based on higher economic growth than the STEPS, so some of the additional gas 
demand is due to higher activity levels. But in order to increase substantially its share of 
overall energy demand, gas needs to replace other sources of energy to a much greater 
extent than is seen in the STEPS. Given its dominance in India's energy system, coal is the 
main target for substitution, and around 40 Mtoe is displaced in the IVC (or around 10% of 
total coal demand in 2019) (Figure 3.24).  
Part of the switching in the IVC also takes place in the industry sector, where gas displaces 
some oil, as well as some biomass which is used in traditional industrial furnaces. However, 
the main change in relation to the STEPS comes in power generation. In the STEPS, installed 
gas-fired capacity remains roughly level through to 2030 (albeit with a steady rise in 
utilisation rates); in the IVC, 35 GW of gas-fired capacity is added over this period.  
Figure 3.24 ? Change in gas demand in the IVC due to fuel switching from coal, 
oil and biomass, 2019-2030 
 
To achieve a gas-based economy in the IVC, gas must displace other fuels  
to a much greater extent than in the STEPS, especially in power. 
 
Non-fossil gases also grow more strongly in the IVC. Some 4 Mtoe of biomethane is 
deployed as bio-CNG by 2030, decreasing the size of the projected fleet of petrol and diesel 
vehicles by around 4%, and helping to reduce oil import dependence and import bills. The 
wider penetration of gas in urban areas in the IVC meanwhile reduces demand in urban 
areas for LPG; this facilitates greater uptake of LPG in rural areas, aiding in the total 
displacement of around 50 Mtoe of biomass by 2030.  
There is no visible trade-off in the IVC between stronger growth of natural gas and the rise 
of renewables. Both enjoy robust growth at the expense of incumbent fuels, and the 
increased share of solar PV in power generation is complemented by the flexibility that 
natural gas provides.  
In order to support the significant level of gas demand growth in the IVC, a number of 
changes are needed that go beyond those assumed in the STEPS. They can be grouped into 
four broad categories: 
?	Accelerated pace of infrastructure growth. In the IVC, annual investment in gas 
infrastructure doubles compared with historical average rates, reaching $5 billion per 
year on average from 2019-30, or a quarter more than in the STEPS. As a result, the 
number of CNG stations expands further, resulting in more comprehensive coverage 
and reduced congestion at stations; LNG terminals, which currently have limited 
connectivity with potential consumers, are better connected to an expanded grid. The 
flexibility and reliability of the gas grid is enhanced by more efficient use of capacity, 
with an independent transmission system operator supporting the roll-out of flexible 
pipeline nomination schedules, and a balancing code which allows a secondary market 
for spare pipeline and LNG capacity.  
?	Faster transition to a competitive and transparent gas market. The IVC implies a rapid 
transition that involves consistent implementation of market-based reforms, a 
rationalisation of applicable taxes and more robust implementation of existing policies, 
such as those related to unbundling. This is key to rationalising end-user prices and 
thereby widening the consumer base. 
? 	More favourable investment climate for domestic producers of various gases. In the 
IVC, annual upstream spending is 60% higher than in the STEPS, and it reaches over $5 
billion by 2030, as continued regulatory and licensing reforms generate greater 
interest in a faster-growing gas market. This spending includes greater investment in 
waste-to-gas and other biomethane projects, as well as investments that accelerate 
progress with low-carbon hydrogen (via electrolysis). Higher incomes in the IVC help to 
support affordability.  
? Stronger policy recognition of positive externalities. Gases produced and transported in 
a responsible way can bring environmental benefits when replacing more polluting 
fuels. The IVC would reduce the carbon intensity of the economy considerably 
compared with the STEPS. An economy that is 14% larger than in the STEPS in 2040 
would be associated with emissions that are 12% lower (see also next section). In 
addition, more rapid development of biomethane would bring rural co-benefits, 
reducing stubble burning and methane emissions and underpinning rural business 
development.  
In the IVC, India imports around 90 bcm of gas from international markets by 2030. It takes 
advantage of today's gas glut, but it also underpins new upstream and midstream 
developments. India's import requirements in the IVC mean that it becomes a linchpin in 
the global LNG balance; those requirements open up a global supply gap in the mid-2020s 
that call for an additional 10 bcm of new projects.  
As LNG requirements grow in the IVC, India's importers are able to play a more active role 
in international gas markets, building a portfolio of supply, shipping and regasification 
stretching beyond India's own territory. This increases their purchasing power and ability to 
optimise supply and demand, bringing greater contractual flexibility on volumes as well as 
the ability to hedge using a diverse set of pricing mechanisms. Regasification capacity 
reaches 170 bcm by 2030, nearly a quarter more than in the STEPS. 
3.3.5 	The environmental implications of gas use in India 
The contribution of natural gas to reaching environmental goals varies widely across 
different countries, between sectors and over time. Where it replaces more polluting fuels, 
it reduces both air pollution and CO2 emissions. But natural gas is not in itself a solution to 
climate change: it is a source of emissions in its own right, and new gas infrastructure can 
lock in these emissions for the future. Our analysis examines these divergent opportunities 
and risks. 
The IVC and the SDS highlight these dynamics in different ways. Gas demand is higher in 
both cases than in the STEPS, but the effect of that additional gas use is to bring down 
emissions further than in the STEPS because of the substitution of gas for coal and oil 
(Figure 3.25). In the IVC, there is a net increase in emissions of around 60 Mt CO2 by 2040 
over 2019 levels from the additional use of gas, compared with a net increase of around 
100 Mt CO2 in the STEPS. So net gas-related emissions still rise from today's levels in the IVC 
but by less than in the STEPS.  
Figure 3.25 ? Effect of gas demand growth in India on CO2 emissions by scenario, 
2019-2040 
 
Gas demand growth in the SDS and IVC causes fewer emissions than in the STEPS, owing to 
greater use of low-carbon gases, and to the use of gas in place of coal and oil. 
 
Note: Lower-carbon gases refer to biomethane and gas-based CCUS in industry, power generation and for 
hydrogen production. Demand growth includes natural gas and biomethane. Switching includes the net 
change in emissions from switching to gas (primarily from oil and coal) and switching from gas (primarily to 
renewables). 
In the SDS, India is the only major country worldwide in which natural gas use to 2040 is 
higher than in the STEPS. The overall expansion of gas demand is associated with a net 
decrease in emissions of around 50 Mt CO2 compared with 2019. This is because, in the 
SDS, natural gas is used to a great extent as a replacement for oil and coal rather than as a 
means of capturing incremental growth in energy demand (which is covered primarily by 
renewables and other low-carbon sources of energy). This role as a substitute for more 
polluting fuels, allied to improvements in end-use efficiency, gives natural gas a place in 
India's transition to a low-carbon economy in the SDS. Emissions reductions in the SDS also 
come from much greater deployment of low-carbon gases, as well as investment in carbon 
capture technologies; at the same time, additional emissions arising from economic growth 
are reduced in the SDS by more extensive use of gas for non-energy purposes than now (i.e. 
as feedstock use in industries). 
Given a relatively carbon-intensive starting point and the policy imperative to expand 
industry and infrastructure, the SDS shows that a carefully managed expansion in the role 
of various gases in India (including low-carbon gases, notably biomethane and hydrogen) 
could bring significant environmental gains, alongside the rapid growth of renewables. 
These gains do, however, depend on effective action to minimise leaks all along India's gas 
value chain, which could quickly negate the climate benefits of natural gas. Moreover, the 
business model for investing in long-lived natural gas infrastructure would require careful 
consideration, as the SDS would see India approaching net zero emissions in the mid-2060s.  
3.4 	Transforming traditional fuels: Coal and bioenergy 
Traditional solid fuels such as coal and biomass account for almost 60% of India's energy 
mix, but both of these fuels face significant uncertainties as India modernises its energy 
system. This section uses the WEO scenarios to explore how the outlook for coal and for 
bioenergy could change in response to the evolving demands of India's energy markets and 
the growing policy focus on sustainable development. 
3.4.1 	Coal supply 
Coal has been a central part of India's energy system for decades (Figure 3.26). Despite 
heavy reliance on oil in the transport sector, and growth in demand for other fuels, coal's 
share in India's energy mix rose from 40% in 2010 to 44% in 2019, and coal continues to be 
the single largest fuel in this mix. Coal accounts for half of the energy produced in India 
today, and coal supply and end use attract a third of total annual energy investment. 
Figure 3.26 ? The share of coal in key energy-related indicators in India, 2019 
 
Coal has maintained a major share in several parts of India's energy sector  
over the period since 2010 even as energy demand has grown by a third.  
 
The majority of coal in India is used for power generation, where its share has remained 
constant in a rapidly growing market (India's electricity demand increased by two-thirds 
between 2010 and 2019). The additional 60 GW of capacity under development could 
further entrench coal's dominant position in the power generation mix (see section 3.2). 
Coal also plays a significant role in India's industrial base because it is the main fuel 
underpinning a sizeable steel manufacturing capability and a growing cement industry.  
Domestic production of coal expanded by 100 Mtce over the last decade, reaching nearly 
410 Mtce in 2019. Investment in coal supply nearly doubled from 2010-19, spurred by the 
government's ambition to reduce and eventually eliminate coal imports. However, the goal 
of raising production to 1.5 billion tonnes (about 800 Mtce), originally set for 2020 (with 1 
billion tonnes targeted from CIL), has recently been pushed back.  
This push back is partly a consequence of supply-side economic challenges, with the 
majority of investments made by domestic companies which are increasingly capital-
constrained as a result of significant overcapacity in parts of the coal value chain. However, 
India's production targets are also becoming more difficult to reconcile with the country's 
evolving energy demands and policy priorities in other areas, particularly in terms of local 
air pollution and CO2 emissions: the coal inputs to the Indian power sector are the fifth-
largest single category of energy sector CO2 emissions globally.  
There is a sizeable 100 GW pipeline of approved coal-fired power projects (including those 
under construction), but it is difficult to see many of these being built, given the challenges 
faced by coal alongside the lower-than-expected electricity demand growth seen in recent 
years. Fierce competition from renewables, especially solar power, is exacerbating the 
already low utilisation of existing coal assets caused by the shortfall in expected demand 
growth, and this is putting several producers under financial strain (see section 3.2.2).  
The challenges faced by coal predated the emergence of Covid-19, but the pandemic has 
served to amplify them. Coal-fired power plants have borne the brunt of the decline in 
electricity demand in 2020, with solar PV and other renewable sources retaining priority 
access to the grid, and gas-fired power generation experiencing an uptick on the back of 
record low LNG prices in the Spring and Summer of 2020. The utilisation of coal-fired power 
plants fell from over 70% in 2010 to 55% in 2019, and the pandemic caused a further fall to 
below 55% (with increased cycling testing technical minimum load factors). Annual 
investment in coal in the power sector has fallen from a peak of $28 billion in 2010 down to 
$11 billion in 2019, and is projected to fall a further 10% in 2020. The pandemic has led to 
even greater uncertainty around the outlook for Indian coal demand (Box 3.6). 
The coal supply balance in STEPS 
The effects of the pandemic, in the form of reduced macroeconomic growth and a more 
subdued outlook for electricity demand, are one factor in a major revision of coal 
consumption projections in the STEPS. A relatively slow recovery from the pandemic sets 
the tone for the following years, and demand ends up one-third lower in 2040 than 
projected in WEO 2019. An accelerated rate of growth in renewables also starts to push 
coal out of the mix: solar eventually usurps coal's title as the king of India's generation fleet. 
The power sector is responsible for nearly 60% of the downward revision in total coal 
demand in the STEPS to 2040. Net capacity growth is 25 GW, or 10% of India's current 
installed coal capacity. 
Meanwhile, solar capacity grows 18-fold, adding 690 GW by 2040. 
Box 3.6 ? 	Hard numbers for coal as India's energy policy ambitions evolve 
The WEO 2015 special focus on India projected that coal use would grow at an average 
annual rate of 3.5% in the New Policies Scenario (the forerunner to the STEPS), 
underpinned by a large planned expansion of coal-fired power capacity. However, 
demand in this scenario has been revised down in successive editions of the World 
Energy Outlook. Average annual growth in the STEPS over the period 2019-40 is now 
just 1.3%, with demand by 2040 ending up more than 40% below what was projected in 
WEO 2015.  
Part of the downward revision is attributable to the effects of Covid-19, as a 
comparison of pre- and post-crisis WEO projections makes clear (Figure 3.27). As India's 
main incumbent fuel, coal's prospects are significantly affected by downward 
adjustments to the country's macroeconomic growth assumptions, which are a key 
driver of total energy demand.  
The prospects for coal have worsened markedly since WEO 2015, due to Covid-19 as 
well as efforts to improve air quality, reduce emissions and diversify the energy mix. 
However, this is only part of the story. Most of the downward adjustments have come 
along gradually in the intervening years since 2015, as a result of improved visibility on 
India's energy policy priorities and targets. Efforts to improve air quality, enhance 
energy efficiency and diversify the energy mix - notably by increasing the use of natural 
gas - have all played a role. India's NDC under the Paris Agreement, committing to a 
reduction in the emissions intensity of the country's energy supply, has also affected 
coal's longerterm prospects, as have downward adjustments to India's anticipated 
future power needs, and the increased competitiveness of solar.  
The coal industry now has to find a way to marry government ambitions to increase 
production with the uncertain demand outlook from coal-fired power plants and industrial 
users. The task is further complicated by the fact that the type, quality and associated cost 
of coal produced in India are not a perfect match for the country's evolving demand profile. 
In particular, the quality of coal produced in India is relatively low, with average calorific 
value in the range of 4 000 kilocalories/kg; this average has been decreasing over time.  
Due to production and quality constraints, as well as the significant distance between coal 
deposits and demand centres, India has been increasing its level of thermal coal imports. 
There are around 18 GW of coal power plants located on the coast that are designed to 
operate using lower-ash imported coal. In recent years, some of these plants have gained a 
competitive edge over plants relying on domestic coal, as the latter have faced high 
processing and transportation costs within India. The trend of rising thermal imports has, 
however, slowed in recent years as a result of lower demand growth and a ramp-up in 
domestic production. This continues in the STEPS, where the share of imports in India's 
thermal coal balance drops below 20% by 2040 (Figure 3.28). 
Figure 3.28 ? India thermal and metallurgical coal demand by sector and the share of 
imports in the STEPS, 2015-2040 
 
A slower pace of demand growth and rising domestic production provide some scope for 
reducing imports of thermal coal, though this is offset by a rise in coking coal imports.  
 
India's steel industry imports around 80% of its coking coal, in the absence of 
costcompetitive domestic coal of sufficient quality. It also utilises around 46 Mtce of 
thermal coal in the production of sponge iron through the direct reduction of iron ore. 
Nearly 85% of thermal coal used in the sector is bought in from South Africa for cost and 
quality reasons. In the STEPS, metallurgical coal imports outpace domestic production, 
reaching 80% by 2040.  
Coal does not fare much better in the IVC than it does in the STEPS, reflecting the difficulty 
of reconciling government ambitions on coal production with other energy policy goals. On 
the demand side, the policy targets in the IVC to increase the share of gas and renewables 
have a negative effect on the outlook for coal use. Despite higher economic growth that 
boosts overall energy demand, and some modest upside from progress towards ambitious 
coal gasification targets, coal demand growth is limited in the IVC to 85 Mtce by 2040. 
Coal's overall share in the energy mix drops to around 33%. 
What are the options to transform the coal industry? 
Where does India's coal industry go from here? It is facing major pressures as a result of a 
changing market and policy context, as well as near-term challenges related to Covid-19. In 
the face of these pressures, coal needs to switch to a much leaner, more cost-efficient 
model for operation and investment. In the remainder of this section, we cover three key 
aspects of this transition: efficiency and operational performance; the push to attract 
private investment; and ways to adapt to increased demands for environmental 
sustainability.  
i. Improving efficiency and operational performance  
There are several efficiency improvements that can be made across the coal value chain. On 
the mining side, there is a stark contrast between the labour productivity of large-scale 
surface mines and small-scale underground mines. Only 10% of underground coal mines in 
India are mechanised, and the average annual output per miner was less than 1 000 tonnes 
in 2019. CIL has begun introducing both mechanical and logistical improvements to improve 
labour and transport margins. As a result, labour productivity has doubled in recent years, 
though it remains well short of labour productivity global averages. In the STEPS, 
productivity doubles again by 2040, but this is primarily due to fewer underground mines 
being required to satisfy production growth, which is mostly captured by more productive 
open cast surface mines.  
There are also numerous efficiency gains possible for coal logistics. Currently, around 60% 
of coal is transported by rail, providing 40% of revenue for Indian Railways. Coal freight 
tariffs are among the highest in the world (IEA, 2020), adding up to $10 additional per 
tonne, as they are designed to help subsidise the cost of passenger rail. Rail transport costs 
are lower for new coastal plants, given the shorter travel distances from port to plant. As 
coal demand centres to the west are increasingly supplied from renewables, the revenues 
from transporting coal from eastern basins will likewise fall. There is little scope to raise 
tariffs on remaining producers to compensate for these declining volumes, implying that 
the current revenue models for railways are likely to require reform. An expansion of rail 
capacity could ease some of the burdens of cross-subsidisation, and a more effective coal 
allocation policy could make transportation more efficient. 
Coal washing is a distinctive additional step in the value chain of India's low-quality 
domestic coal base (Figure 3.29). Higher-ash coal increases transport costs per unit of 
energy delivered, decreases boiler efficiency and can also increase emissions if technical 
equipment to capture particulate emissions is not used when the coal is burned. Rule 
changes in 2020 removed limitations on the use of high-ash coal, allowing power plants to 
use coal irrespective of its ash content, and removed the stipulation that high-ash coal 
could not be transported more than 500 km from the pithead. These changes may reduce 
reliance on thermal coal imports and may generally be a cost-effective way of utilising 
domestic resources, but any gains are likely to come at the cost of increased emissions from 
higher ash content, reduced plant efficiencies and increased transport requirements. 
Figure 3.29 ? Share of coal production by quality of coal in India, 2010-2018 
The decline in the quality of India's domestically produced coal  has 
given rise to a number of logistical and cost-related challenges. 
 
On the demand side, three-quarters of India's existing coal power plants are subcritical 
units which use low-efficiency technology. As a result of new government requirements, 
around 80% of the coal capacity under construction is in the form of supercritical plants 
with higher efficiencies, operating with an efficiency of around 36-40%, together with a 
small number of ultra-supercritical plants. This marginally increases the overall efficiency of 
the fleet in the STEPS, with the result that around 20 Mtce less coal-fired generation is 
needed in 2030 than would have been required if the same amount of generation had to be 
produced at today's efficiency levels. However, there are several countervailing forces in 
the STEPS that could also reduce plant efficiencies: for example, efforts to move away from 
imports would allow greater scope for inefficient domestic subcritical coal units to generate 
power. Moreover, coal plants tend to operate less efficiently when running under lower 
rates of utilisation or subjected to more frequent ramping, and this is how they have to 
operate in the STEPS in order to accommodate a growing share of variable renewables. ii. 
The push for private investment in coal production 
CIL, the world's largest coal producer by tonnage, supplies over 80% of the domestic market 
for coal in India and employs around two-thirds of the 500 000 workers directly employed 
by the coal sector (CIL, 2020). Most of CIL's production is sold via long-term fuel supply 
agreements, with another 10-20% sold via e-auctions, enabling buyers to procure additional 
quantities of coal on a flexible basis. The remaining supply is mostly produced by smaller, 
primarily state-owned companies, although a minority of supply (less than 3%) comes from 
fully private companies. A model by which private companies can be subcontracted as 
mining developer operators has begun to take root, while the gradual opening of the coal 
mining and distribution market has encouraged both large public-sector undertakings and 
smaller private firms, including those owning captive coal power plants, to capture more of 
the coal value chain. 
Figure 3.30 ? India coal production by investment type in the STEPS 
 
Government ambitions to increase domestic coal production and stem the 
increase in imports imply significant investment in existing and new mines. 
 
India recently introduced commercial coal mining, which is the most significant reform 
undertaken in the coal sector since it was nationalised in the 1970s. The marketing 
monopoly of CIL has ceased, meaning private companies can develop new mines based on 
government auctions of unallocated coal mines or blocks, and can sell coal in the market 
without price or end-user restrictions. To ease the financial burden on new players, the 
government has reduced upfront payments, relaxed payment schedules and introduced 
pricing off a new national coal index. In 2020, India announced the public auction of 41 coal 
blocks to encourage private investment and spur increased efficiencies. So far, only 19 
blocks have been awarded, covering 50 Mt of new supply. The prospects are highly 
uncertain (as highlighted by the variation in coal supply across our scenarios), but in the 
STEPS there are new investments in mining projects that compensate for the decline in 
mature coalproducing basins. Around 40% of coal production by 2040 in India comes from 
greenfield investments in the STEPS (Figure 3.30), compared with 20% globally.  
iii. Adapt to growing demands for environmental sustainability  
India has to deal with several environmental challenges linked to the production and use of 
coal, including air pollution, water stress and GHG emissions. Most mines are large-scale 
surface mines which lead to intense land-use change, necessitating a robust reclamation 
policy to avoid harmful long-term effects. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of 
air pollution, and are also responsible for around 45% of total energy-related CO2 emissions 
in India.  
Addressing these environmental effects requires action on a broad number of fronts. In 
2015, the Indian government introduced stricter pollutant emissions norms for thermal 
plants, moving beyond an earlier focus on particulate matter to include restrictions on 
sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide, water and mercury pollutants. However, an ambitious 
deadline has passed with compliance levels remaining low, and an extension of the target 
date for compliance to 2022 may still fall short as plants have been slow in conducting 
feasibility studies and tendering for the necessary air pollution control upgrades. This is 
due, in large part, to a reluctance to incur investment costs to achieve compliance. In the 
STEPS it is projected that all coal plants will eventually be fully aligned with these rules, 
meaning sulphur dioxide emissions from coal plants are 90% below today's levels by 2040 
(see section 4.2). 
Reducing CO2 emissions from existing coal plants is the single most important way of 
bending the emissions curve for India. If run at today's levels of utilisation, assuming 
average technical lifetimes of around 50 years, existing and under-construction plants 
would emit 25 Gt CO2 cumulatively between 2019 and 2040, equivalent to 50% of India's 
total cumulative emissions in the SDS over this period. Avoiding this "locked-in" stock of 
emissions is both financially and logistically challenging, especially since the average coal 
plant in India is only around 15 years old, with an efficiency of around 35%, compared with 
a global average of 42%. 
Several routes to transforming the role played by coal-fired power plants appear in the SDS, 
and they principally involve retrofitting, repurposing or retiring existing coal assets, 
particularly less-efficient subcritical units. WEO analysis has assessed the least-cost pathway 
to reducing emissions in the coal industry in India along these lines (IEA, 2019). Running 
coal facilities to focus on providing power system adequacy and flexibility, thereby reducing 
baseload operations, saves 6 200 Mt CO2 in the SDS, compared with the STEPS, from 2019 
to 2040. A further 3 100 Mt CO2 is also avoided in the SDS by retiring coal plants early, 
starting with the oldest, lowest-efficiency and least system-relevant plants. These measures 
alone would close around 75% of the emissions gap that exists between the STEPS and SDS 
in the period from 2019 to 2040.  
Such measures ultimately lead to a reduction in Indian coal demand in the SDS, with 
demand falling below 300 Mtce by 2040 (Figure 3.31). The SDS also sees more gains than 
the STEPS from the use of coal-consuming industrial facilities and plants fitted with CCUS, 
which provides a route to emissions reductions for sectors consuming both thermal and 
metallurgical coal. 
Figure 3.31 ? Difference in coal demand between STEPS and SDS, by sector and 
technology, 2015-2040 
 
 
	2015	2020	2025	2030	2035	2040	 
A reduced role for coal-fired power, especially subcritical plants, plays an  important 
part in bringing about change in India's coal demand in the SDS. 
 
Note: USC = ultra-supercritical. 
Box 3.7 ? 	Is India fresh out of coal water? 
More than 80% of coal plants today are cooled by freshwater sources. Over 50% of 
these are in areas experiencing high water stress (Figure 3.32). Almost all fossil fuel 
capacity under construction is coal-fired, but the share of that capacity being built with 
dry and non-freshwater cooling is significantly higher than in the past (17% dry and 20% 
non-freshwater, compared with 2% dry and 6% non-freshwater for existing capacity). As 
a result, the share of coal capacity that is freshwater-cooled in plants that are under 
construction is just over 60%.  
There are several alternatives to the use of fresh water. India's third-largest coal power 
plant, Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project, was built in a drought-prone area and uses 
desalinated seawater for cooling and other end-use applications to avoid aggravating 
water stress. The use of wastewater for cooling is another alternative, and the 
government has mandated coal plants to use sewage water if they are located in close 
proximity to municipal treatment plants. Shifting to dry cooling or air-cooled condenser 
technology would eliminate the need for water entirely, but this involves significantly 
more investment and carries a penalty in the form of reduced efficiency, and very few 
coal plants in India employ these alternative cooling methods. Although low water use 
approaches are technically viable, a significant shift towards water-saving interventions 
in Indian power plants is likely to require financial support.  
Bioenergy has a dual identity in India's energy system. A full 12% of India's energy needs 
today are met through traditional uses of biomass: fuelwood, straw, dung, charcoal burnt in 
three-stone fire or inefficient cook stoves. These sources are particularly prevalent in rural 
areas where they are used for cooking and a variety of other household purposes. 
Bioenergy in India is often thought of in terms of such traditional sources, which have been 
a focus for reduction on account of their harmful effects on human health. Each year, the 
air pollutants emitted from combusting traditional biomass indoors cause around 600 000 
premature deaths. 
There is another side to the bioenergy story in India, and this is focused on modern 
technologies and supply chains that can put India's substantial level of organic feedstock 
and waste to productive use. These produce bioenergy that can power vehicles, provide 
energy services for households, generate local heat and power, and help meet the energy 
needs of a wide variety of industries. Scaling up the technologies and supply chains that 
convert organic products into useful energy can help India address core sustainable 
development goals: ensuring affordable access to modern energy supplies, combating 
climate change and, if carefully managed, improving air quality as well. The development of 
local bioenergy supply chains can also address a range of other policy priorities, from 
reducing the need for imported crude oil to fostering more efficient waste management 
practices. 
Status of bioenergy today 
India's bioenergy potential has long been recognised by the government, and several 
support schemes have been put in place for the development of biogas and biomethane 
plants, biomass co-generation plants,  and industrial and waste-to-energy plants. Different 
types of bioenergy sources have received different levels of support and attention: 
?	Modern solid biomass. Over the past decade, India has built 11 GW of biomass power 
and co-generation plants, primarily for the provision of local heat and power, which in 
2019 generated around 40 TWh, roughly the same as solar PV. The government has, in 
particular, incentivised the use of the bagasse as a fuel for co-generation, leading to 
the commissioning of almost 8 GW of capacity (Ministry of New and Renewable 
Energy, 2020). 
Biofuels. The government has set targets for transport biofuels as a means to reduce 
the need for imported crude oil. In 2019, India produced around 28 thousand barrels 
of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d), enough to support a 4% blending rate in gasoline, 
which displaced less than 1% of crude oil imports. Bioethanol production has varied 
over the years due to changes in feedstock availability, oil prices and government 
incentives (a recent example being the removal of excise duty exemptions for 
bioethanol). India's new biofuels policy, announced in 2018, targets bioethanol 
blending in gasoline of up to 10% in 2022 and 20% in 2030 and plans for the 
construction of 12 biorefineries. Negligible quantities of biodiesel are produced today, 
although there are also targets to achieve blending rates in diesel of 5% by 2030. 
Efforts are now under way to develop the supply chains necessary to produce 
biodiesel, especially from used cooking oil. 
Biogas. India has long-standing programmes providing support for household-scale 
bio-digesters as a clean cooking solution in rural areas where LPG access is limited, and 
for larger-scale projects providing local heat and power generation. Around 5 million 
household-scale biogas units are currently in operation today. Biogas production also 
yields "digestate" as a by-product, which can be used as a fertiliser. 
Biomethane. A form of biogas that is upgraded to higher quality specifications, 
biomethane is being targeted for use in the transport sector as a sustainable fuel, for 
gas-based vehicles. Under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable 
Transportation (SATAT) scheme, the government has a production target of 15 Mt of 
bio-CNG by 2023. It has taken action in support of this target, for example by providing 
off-take guarantees and long-term pricing agreements, and by including bio-CNG 
facilities in the Reserve Bank of India's priority sector lending. 
Many of the existing bioenergy supply chains in India rely on dedicated energy crops - 
which may compete with food for agricultural land and have adverse sustainability impacts 
(e.g. CO2 emissions and other land-use impacts that can be associated with land clearing 
and cultivation) - or on the collected biomass that is burned in its original place for 
traditional use in households. These avenues do not do justice to the positive and 
sustainable role that bioenergy could play in India's energy mix. We consider below the 
overall potential for bioenergy sources derived only from feedstock which can be 
considered sustainable, before assessing the outlook in the STEPS. 
Assessing the potential of sustainable bioenergy feedstock  
Due to the size and scale of its agricultural sector, India has vast quantities of organic waste 
that can be used as feedstock in modern bioenergy supply chains. Currently, only a small 
fraction of this sustainable potential is utilised. 
Around 600 Mt of agricultural waste in India are generated each year, the majority of which 
are agricultural residues left over after the harvest. This includes around 40 Mt of rice crop 
residue, known as paddy straw, which is burned annually in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and 
Uttar Pradesh. The burning of this residue typically occurs over a time frame of six weeks in 
October and November, and is one of the primary causes of the air pollution crisis every 
year in northern India, with as much as half of the particulate pollutants in a city like Delhi 
attributable to this burning. As the world's second-largest producer of sugar cane, India also 
produces huge quantities of bagasse, an energy-rich by-product of sugarcane processing.  
A range of agricultural feedstocks can be used for the production of transport biofuels. A 
distinction is often made between conventional biofuels, which rely on energy crops and 
often compete with food supply, and advanced biofuels, which can be derived from organic 
waste and non-food materials. Bioethanol in India is currently mostly produced from 
molasses, but some is derived from surplus food grains such as corn and cassava. The new 
biofuels policy released in 2018 has expanded the list of allowable feedstock sources, which 
now includes crop residues and industrial and municipal wastes, including used cooking oils. 
Livestock manure is another amply available feedstock, and is particularly well-suited to the 
production of biogas. 
Organic waste is another source of potential feedstock. It constitutes 40-50% of the 60 Mt 
of total municipal solid waste generated in urban areas in India each year, and it is likely to 
total around 100 million tonnes a year by 2040, as cities continue to grow: it can be used in 
wasteto-energy plants and for the production of various bioenergy sources. 
Forest industries also provide potential bioenergy feedstock: residues from wood 
processing
(e.g. produced in sawmills) are relatively cheap and accessible, but residues from logging 
activities are mostly left on site and would require additional support to be collected. 
Along with other forms of organic waste such as wastewater sludge, all of the above 
sources can be processed with existing technologies. Taking account of the energy content 
of the various feedstocks, we assess that up to 130 Mtoe of useful energy could be derived 
from these sustainable organic waste streams (Figure 3.33). There are multiple co-benefits 
to employing waste in this way, including reduced air pollution, avoided emissions, and 
rural and agricultural development. Using organic waste also ensures that the nascent 
bioenergy industry develops in partnership with food production, instead of as a 
competitor to it. 
Figure 3.33 ? Bioenergy potential from organic waste in India, 2019-2040 
 
 
Organic waste could produce 130 Mtoe of useful energy today,  
equivalent to 15% of India's total energy demand. 
 
There are, however, numerous challenges facing those seeking to scale up modern 
bioenergy supply chains. These vary depending on the type of bioenergy produced, but 
there are some common elements:  
Supply chain uncertainties. Agricultural waste sources are dispersed around the 
country, sometimes across multiple small landholdings. They differ greatly in terms of 
their quality and composition, and hence also in their suitability for different 
conversion technologies. There is also significant uncertainty about the level of 
availability or reliability of different waste streams. These challenges are compounded 
by a lack of awareness of the potential uses and technologies.  
High upfront costs and financing challenges. Local banks often serve as a first port of 
call for raising the capital necessary for bioenergy projects, since the loan 
requirements are too large for individual investors (e.g. farmers) to fund themselves. 
There is limited knowledge among financial institutions about how to assess the 
viability of projects, and this adds to the difficulty of securing funding.  
Competing uses of biomass for non-energy purposes. The biomass or organic waste 
with significant potential to be used as modern bioenergy often tends to have 
competing alternative uses, for example as fodder for animals, manure for fields, or 
fuel for direct burning in household cooking and industrial processes. 
A lack of guaranteed off-takers of bioenergy. Finding reliable outlets can be hard, 
since procurement prices often do not reflect the co-benefits of employing waste for 
energy, such as efficient waste management, reduced air pollution and enhanced 
access to locally produced energy.  
The outlook for bioenergy in the STEPS 
In the STEPS, a determined policy push brings about a drastic reduction of traditional uses 
of biomass by 2040. This leads to 270 million people, a population four times the size of 
France, shifting away from traditional uses, and to a 40% decrease in demand. The changes 
that take place are the result of greater use of LPG - the main route to clean cooking - and 
also of biogas and electricity, together with the development and adoption of improved 
biomass cook stoves.  
 
Bioenergy plays a significant role as a renewable heat source for industry and buildings. 
Biofuels use rises six-fold by 2040, capturing a larger share of overall transport demand. 
 
Note: Heat includes industry, residential and commercial.  
Modern bioenergy use goes in the opposite direction, doubling from 2019 to 2040 to reach 
140 Mtoe in 2040. Industrial uses, especially in agro industries, account for almost 40% of 
modern bioenergy growth. Much of the rest of the growth comes from power and 
commercial heat generation, for which ambitious targets have been set by both the 
government and some private players.  India's biofuel policies also support significant 
growth in transport demand, and dominate the growth of renewable energy use in the heat 
sector (Figure 3.34). 
There is also growing interest in biomethane as a local and often cheaper alternative to 
imported natural gas. India is home to 8% of global biomethane production potential, and 
using all of it would be sufficient to meet India's entire current gas demand (Figure 3.35). 
Around 2 bcm of biomethane could be developed at a cost below the weighted average gas 
price in India, making it competitive against conventional CNG for use in the transport 
sector, and there are already ambitious efforts, through the SATAT scheme, to bring about 
greater use of gas in the transport sector. In the STEPS, least-cost technologies - landfill gas 
recovery and agricultural digesters - supply almost 20 bcm of biomethane in 2040 to 
compete with imported gas. Most of this continues to be used in the transport sector: more 
than 10% of cars and half of the bus fleet run on gas in 2040 in the STEPS. 
Figure 3.35 ? Assessment of biomethane potential in India and quantities developed in 
the STEPS 
 
Biomethane use grows strongly in the STEPS, reaching 20 bcm by 2040, but 
this is only a small fraction of the total potential.  
 
The key challenge to wider deployment of biomethane relates to costs. Currently, more 
than half of the biomethane potential would be competitive only with a natural gas price 
above $9/MBtu, exceeding the gas import prices reached in STEPS in the mid-2020s. There 
are a number of options to narrow this cost gap, such as crediting both the carbon and 
methane emissions savings from biomethane, providing tax exemptions in the final sale 
price, or giving biomethane preferential access to gas infrastructure. For example, a CO2 
price of $25/tonne would double the volume of cost-competitive biomethane that could be 
developed in India by 2040; crediting avoided methane emissions would reduce the CO2 
price required by 20%, taking it down to around $20/tonne. Some biomethane facilities 
might be able to avoid gas transmission tariffs altogether if they are built close to demand 
centres, such as CNG facilities or CGD projects. However, scaling up biomethane supply to a 
significant level would ultimately require a co-ordinated approach involving feedstock-rich 
states and both local distribution and national transmission gas grids.  
The role of bioenergy in the IVC and the SDS 
In the IVC, an alignment of agricultural, energy and environmental interests ensures that 
bioenergy occupies a more prominent place among government policy priorities than in the 
STEPS (Figure 3.36). At the country level, universal use of clean cooking is achieved by 2030 
(see section 4.2). As a consequence, traditional uses of biomass are phased out as nearly 
700 million people gain access to clean cooking between 2019 and 2040. Modern bioenergy 
demand reaches 160 Mtoe as clean cooking policies boost the use of improved biomass 
cook stoves and biodigesters for household needs, and as the take-up of modern bioenergy 
in the industry and transport sector rises significantly. 

 
The enhanced co-ordination of incentives among central and state governments plays an 
important role in the IVC in accelerating the implementation of bioenergy production 
processes, with support schemes tailored to both small- and large-scale producers. 
Effective regulatory support and wider uptake of the most cost-effective technologies also 
help to lay the groundwork for growth. India pursues multiple pathways to developing 
bioenergy, with local, on-site development projects as well as initiatives to collect and 
transport multiple sources of waste to centralised, larger-scale plants. The majority of the 
$60 billion cumulative investment from 2019 to 2040 in bioenergy bolsters domestic supply 
chains and creates local jobs, especially in rural areas. 
Supporting policies also lead to a wider development of biomethane plants. In 2040, 
biomethane use is 40% higher in the IVC than in the STEPS. Most of the increase occurs in 
the transport sector, with biomethane accounting for 5% of total transport energy demand 
in 2040 in the IVC, which comes on top of the 5% of demand that is met by liquid biofuels. 
In the SDS, the use of modern forms of bioenergy grows much more strongly, and there is 
also a major increase in the use of alternative feedstocks that minimise or avoid potential 
sustainability concerns. India manages to exploit more fully its waste crop oils, animal fats, 
agricultural and forestry residues, and municipal wastes. These feedstocks sustain a more 
than doubling of modern bioenergy consumption between 2019 and 2040, underpinned by 
rapid growth in advanced biofuels, biogas and biomethane. 
 


Implications for India and the world 
India's energy choices matter. They have direct and far-reaching effects on the lives 
of a growing population, and major indirect effects on the rest of the world through 
their impact on energy markets, emissions, and flows of technology and capital.  
In the STEPS, India accounts for nearly one-quarter of global energy demand growth 
from 2019-40, which is more than any other country. Already a heavyweight in solar 
PV, India becomes a world leader in battery storage. By 2040, India's power system 
eclipses the European Union's and becomes the world's third-largest, and it is the 
second-largest growth market for renewable energy after China.  
India's growing strength in the global industrial economy has important implications 
for coal and gas markets. India leads global oil demand growth in the STEPS on the 
back of a fivefold increase in per capita car ownership, and also becomes the 
fastestgrowing market for natural gas. India is in addition one of the very few 
sources of growth for coal in this scenario, largely for industrial use.  
India's influence is felt across all fuels and technologies, as well as in global emissions. 
India already imports around 40% of its primary energy and overall reliance on 
imports remains at this level to 2040 in the STEPS. However, India's combined import 
bill for fossil fuels triples over this period, with oil by far the largest component. The 
SDS sees an oil import bill which is $1.4 trillion smaller over the period 2019-40 than 
in the STEPS: these savings offset entirely the additional costs of clean energy 
investments required in the SDS.  
The rapidly rising requirement for flexibility in the operation of its power system is a 
potential hazard for electricity security in India. One additional systemic risk comes 
from the poor financial health of discoms. Improving billing and collection efficiency 
and reducing technical and commercial losses are key to reforming the sector. 
Stepping up investment in renewables also means tackling risks relating to delayed 
payments to generators, land acquisition, and regulatory and contract certainty.  
In the STEPS, the combined markets in India for solar PV modules, wind turbines, 
lithium-ion batteries and water electrolysers grow to over $40 billion per year by 
2040; in the SDS they grow to twice this size. With a 10-35% market share for some 
of these products, India has the opportunity to capture more of the value from 
these supply chains by positioning itself as a hub for innovation and research 
expertise. In order to support this transformation, India's clean energy workforce 
grows by 1 million from 2020 to 2030 in the STEPS, and by 1.6 million in the SDS. 
Policies to improve air quality and expand access to clean cooking in the STEPS help 
to limit pollutant emissions, but a rising urban population means that more people 
are exposed to air pollution and suffer its ill effects. The IVC and especially the SDS 
see a lasting reduction in premature deaths from poor air quality, with several 
related co-benefits for energy security and trade.  
Growth in India's annual CO2 emissions slows steadily over time in the STEPS, largely 
because power sector emissions plateau after 2030 due to the rising share of 
renewables in electricity generation. A cleaner power mix also strengthens the case 
for the electrification of transport; at present, the carbon intensity of electricity in 
India means that there is no CO2 benefit from switching to an electric car.  
Despite a steady slowing in their overall rate of growth, India's total emissions in the 
STEPS are around 50% higher in 2040 than in 2019, though per capita CO2 emissions 
remain low by international standards. Enhanced efforts to cut coal use in power 
generation and to improve the efficiency and carbon intensity of industrial output 
bring about lower emissions in the IVC, together with higher GDP. The SDS sees even 
more far-reaching improvements in efficiency and in the penetration of low-carbon 
technologies, cutting emissions much further. 
The SDS demonstrates that robust economic expansion is fully compatible with an 
increasing pace of emissions reductions and the achievement of other sustainable 
development goals. India's energy-related CO2 emissions flatten out in this scenario 
in the 2020s and go into steady decline by the 2030s, on track to reach net-zero by 
the mid-2060s. This decisive break with historical trends requires tackling emissions 
from existing infrastructure while also avoiding new sources of emissions wherever 
possible. In the STEPS, by the late 2030s most of India's annual emissions come from 
factories, vehicles, buildings and power plants that do not yet exist. 
India's technology choices have to take into account water availability and 
competing water demands. Thermal power plants are already vulnerable to water 
stress; without careful planning, some low-carbon energy options - most notably 
nuclear, bioenergy and concentrating solar power - could be limited by water 
availability in the future. 

4.1 	Overview of energy sustainability and security 
4.1.1 	Perspectives to 2040 
The Covid-19 pandemic has cast a shadow over India's development trajectory. Much 
uncertainty remains over the duration of the crisis, the shape of the recovery and the 
nature of further energy-related stimulus measures that may be enacted by the 
government. Throughout this report, we highlight the range of potential outcomes, 
distinguishing between temporary dislocations and more durable structural changes. In this 
chapter, we focus on the implications of those outcomes for energy security and for 
sustainable development. 
In the STEPS, the pandemic is gradually brought under control over the course of 2021. An 
economic rebound lays the foundation for a return to robust GDP growth for the remainder 
of the decade, and India is the main source of global growth in energy consumption over 
the Outlook period, making it a pivotal country for market trends across all fuels and 
technologies. Although India's per capita CO2 emissions remain well below the global 
average, total emissions in the STEPS end up 50% higher by 2040, rising almost in tandem 
with demand growth. The increase in India's emissions offsets the projected decline in 
emissions in Europe over this period, and makes India the second-largest source of global 
CO2 emissions by 2040 (Figure 4.2). India's energy access goals are meanwhile met only in 
part; around 500 million Indians remain without access to clean cooking in 2030. 
Figure 4.2 ? 	Average energy supply investments in India by scenario and global 
CO2 emissions by region in the STEPS and the SDS, 2019-40 
 
India's emissions outlook is shaped by the pace at which it scales up renewables, and the 
infrastructure necessary to integrate them, while transitioning away from coal.  
 
India is one of the few major countries globally that sees a rise in coal demand in the STEPS. 
This additional coal is primarily for industrial use, and means that its share of global coal 
demand grows from around 10% in 2019 to more than 15% in 2040. India is already an 
important market for internationally traded oil and gas, and its requirements increase in 
the STEPS: its oil import bill rises to over $250 billion by 2040, almost three times higher 
than in 2019, while imports of LNG cover nearly 70% of gas demand growth, with supplies 
coming from a diverse set of exporters including Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, the Russian 
Federation (hereafter, "Russia"), and the United States. 
Near-term risks to sustainable development would be heightened in the event of a 
prolonged pandemic. The DRS sees the initial resilience of clean energy investment eroded 
over time by weakening government and corporate balance sheets, slowing the pace of 
structural change in the energy sector. Emissions of CO2 and of air pollutants are 
suppressed to some extent in this scenario as a result of diminished economic prospects 
and lower energy demand, but these emissions reductions come at a very high cost in 
terms of India's economic and social development. Progress towards a range of sustainable 
development objectives is set back: improvements in access to clean cooking, for example, 
slow to less than a third of historical levels, meaning 600 million people remain dependent 
on traditional use of solid biomass in 2030.  
A much more upbeat picture emerges in the IVC, in which muted growth in emissions 
(400 Mt CO2 lower than in STEPS in 2040) is associated with substantial progress on 
renewable energy goals and greater strides towards energy efficiency. Access goals are 
achieved by 2030, with substantial air quality improvements made as the country moves 
away from traditional biomass and meets transport efficiency and electrification goals. 
India becomes a world leader in battery storage and is one of the fastest-growing markets 
for renewable energy globally. India also remains central to global energy trade, although 
imports of coal and oil are lower than in the STEPS, and imports of gas higher.  
As in the IVC, India in the SDS meets in full its targets to reduce air pollution while ensuring 
universal energy access to clean cooking. However, energy-related CO2 emissions follow a 
very different trajectory. In the SDS, India charts a pathway out of the crisis which focuses 
on investment in clean energy technologies; whereas in the IVC around 90% of primary 
energy demand growth is met by fossil fuels over the next decade, in the SDS this falls to 
around a third and there is significant substitution away from more polluting to less 
polluting fuels. As a result, emissions peak in the SDS in the mid-2020s, and end up more 
than a third below 2019 levels by 2040, even though energy demand grows by more than 
20%.  
There is a huge reallocation of capital in the SDS in favour of low-carbon fuels and 
technologies, with solar and wind alone attracting an average of $35 billion investment 
spending per year in the period 2030-40, an almost threefold increase on today's levels. 
Renewable integration challenges also call for far more spending on electricity networks. 
The additional investment needed is, however, offset by reduced spending on oil due to 
transport electrification and tighter efficiency standards: this translates into a 15% fall in 
India's oil imports, and a consequent saving between 2019 and 2040 of $1.4 trillion 
compared with the STEPS. Even though LNG demand is higher than in the STEPS the total 
import bill for gas is lower, as the greater surplus of global gas supply has a dampening 
effect on prices. 
India and the Sustainable Development Goals 
India has made considerable progress in recent years towards achieving the UN SDGs. This 
section examines recent progress towards the energy-related SDGs, and looks at what 
policies or measures could help to accelerate action. Progress on the energy-related SDGs 
offers the prospect of faster progress towards the achievement of other SDGs as well, 
including those related to health, education, water and sanitation that are often hampered 
by a lack of reliable electricity access and poor air quality. 
4.2.1 	Access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services 
The UN SDG 7.1 calls for ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy 
services.  
Electricity access 
India has made great progress on electricity access in recent years through the Saubhagya 
Scheme, and government data indicate that more than 99% of households were connected 
to electricity in 2019. There are, however, continuing problems with the quality and 
reliability of electricity access for connected households, and with access for non-household 
customers: studies found that less than 80% of institutional customers, 65% of small 
businesses and 50% of agricultural customers had been connected to the grid in 2018  (Bali, 
Vermani, & Mishra, 2020; Dayal, 2019). 
There is a risk that the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic effects could reverse recent 
gains and push some connected households back into energy poverty. In India, up to 40 
million people with electricity connections could lose the ability to pay for an extended 
bundle of electricity services (IEA, 2020).  Some low-income households are facing the 
need to make trade-offs between their energy needs and other demands, and this could 
propel them back to traditional and inefficient fuels.  
In the STEPS, near-universal access to electricity is maintained, despite India's population 
increasing by 130 million people over the next 10 years. Around $35 billion is spent on 
average each year over the 2021-30 period on the construction and refurbishment of 
transmission and distribution lines - a substantial increase on today's levels - and subsidy 
schemes support increased electricity use by poor households. Residential electricity 
consumption increases from around 1 000 kWh per household in 2019 to 1 500 kWh in 
2030 as a result of increased household revenues and improved central grid reliability. This 
nonetheless remains far below electricity consumption in advanced economies (6 000 kWh 
per household in 2030), and there are still some reliability and affordability issues, with 
many households not able to maintain uninterrupted access to electricity.  
On-grid electrification remains the most economic option for the majority of Indian 
consumers gaining access to modern energy services, especially with rising household 
consumption from growing appliance ownership, and it accounts for around 99% of the 
connections realised within the Saubhagya Scheme. However, in certain cases - especially 
in remote rural locations - standalone systems and mini-grids offer a viable alternative for 
ensuring reliable access to electricity services to complement the main grid. Diesel 
generators are one well-established option, but renewables are expected to play a growing 
role as the costs of solar PV fall and as solutions emerge which allow electricity to be stored 
for use in the evenings. India has various policies in place backing solar home systems, solar 
pumps and mini-grids, such as the Off-Grid and Decentralised Solar PV Programme and the 
Kusum scheme to replace existing diesel pumps with solar PV pumps. Such measures 
translate into steady increases in deployment, providing increased access to farmers and 
other rural consumers. 
Both the IVC and the SDS see additional policies and measures to boost the affordability, 
reliability and use of electricity by households and other customers. Support is also 
provided for poor households to purchase more efficient appliances, allowing them to 
increase their access to services without compromising electricity affordability. At the same 
time, efficiency improvements facilitate improvements to electricity security by reducing 
the growth in electricity demand, including peak demand. Regulations and incentives 
further boost the deployment of decentralised systems. 
Access to clean cooking 
Progress on clean cooking access has been slower than progress on electricity access, 
hampered in part by affordability and supply issues. As noted in Chapter 1, the government 
has made huge efforts to expand access to LPG through the PMUY scheme. Even though 
97.5% of households today have the ability to access LPG (Indian Ministry of Petroleum & 
Natural Gas, 2020), we estimate that around 650 million people, just under half of India's 
population, continue to rely primarily on traditional uses of biomass in households (and so 
are counted as not having access).  This is an issue in rural areas in particular: more than 
90% of those without access live in rural areas.  
Where LPG connections have been made, they have not always unlocked sustained use due 
to concerns about supply, as well as cultural factors. A primary difficulty is the need to 
purchase quantities of LPG in bulk: even with government subsidies, other fuels are often 
available more cheaply, or in smaller quantities, and are therefore a better fit with the 
income structure of poor households. In addition, the LPG bottling and distribution 
infrastructure is not yet ready to sustain the use of LPG by all households, even if they have 
a connection. Efforts to create new private distributors in rural areas are often hampered 
by a lack of adequate financial returns  (Josey, Sreenivas & Dabadge, 2019). 

In the STEPS, traditional uses of biomass continue to be used by 500 million people as the 
main way of cooking in 2030; in the IVC, this is replaced by a wide range of alternatives.  
 
Note: Fuel shares in the SDS are similar to the IVC. 
In the STEPS, more than 170 million people move from the traditional uses of biomass to 
alternative clean cooking options over the period to 2030. However, taking into account 
population growth, this leaves around 500 million people without access. As a result, there 
are still nearly 0.6 million premature deaths due to indoor air pollution in 2030. 
In the IVC and the SDS, full access to and full reliance on clean cooking is achieved by 2030, 
meaning that close to 670 million people gain access to clean cooking over the next 10 
years. LPG is the mainstay of clean cooking access efforts; three-quarters of India's 
population rely primarily on LPG for cooking by 2030, and LPG demand increases by 50% 
between 2019 and 2030. Investments and incentives are deployed to expand infrastructure 
for LPG bottling and distribution and for the repair and replacement of broken stoves. 
Innovative subsidy schemes play a key role in supporting the sustained use of LPG and 
eliminate stacking of traditional fuels.   
The use of improved biomass cook stoves and biogas also makes an important contribution, 
providing clean cooking to around 180 million people in 2030. They are especially important 
in locations where there is more resistance to replacing traditional solutions, or where 
reliable LPG delivery is more difficult to ensure, and in locations with a ready supply of 
biogas feedstock. In urban areas, natural gas meets an increasing share of cooking needs in 
the IVC and the SDS through the development of gas distribution infrastructure in major 
cities. This helps to displace LPG in urban areas and allow its increased use in rural areas 
where the development of gas distribution infrastructure is more challenging. There is also 
a role for electricity in providing clean cooking access, especially in urban areas, where 6 
million people gain access through electric cook stoves by 2030.  
4.2.2 	Energy and air pollution 
Improvements in air quality are crucial for the achievement of multiple SDGs. Ensuring 
access to clean energy (SDG 7.1) would reduce household air pollution; increasing the share 
of renewable energy (SDG 7.2) would permanently reduce power sector air pollution; 
improving energy efficiency (SDG 7.3) would likewise tackle air pollutant concentrations 
across the energy economy; enhancing access to sustainable transport (SDG 11.2) would 
improve the overall air quality in cities (SDG 11.6). Air pollution policies also offer direct co-
benefits for GHG emissions reductions (SDG 13). 
As described in Chapter 1, air pollution has emerged as one of India's most pressing 
environmental challenges, and the energy sector is the largest source of three of the major 
air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and PM2.5. PM2.5 is the air 
pollutant of most concern as concentrations exceed the NAAQS in many monitored 
locations. NOX emissions are increasingly problematic in urban areas, while SO2 
concentrations are a particular issue in areas with many thermal power or industrial plants.  
Figure 4.4 ? 	Sectoral contributions to air pollution levels in the STEPS and SDS 
 
 
Air pollutant emissions fall in the power and transport sectors through to 2040 in the STEPS, 
but only SO2 emissions fall significantly in overall terms, and industrial emissions grow.  
 
Combustion-related emissions of PM2.5 made up more than two-thirds of total household 
air pollution in 2019. Pollution largely results from the incomplete burning of traditional 
biomass, such as fuelwood or agricultural residues, used for cooking and heating activities. 
Policy efforts to promote access to clean cooking led to a 16% decline in emissions between 
2015 and 2019 to 4.7 Mt. 
The power sector was responsible for half of the 8.5 Mt of total SO2 emissions in 2019, with 
industrial activities contributing an additional one-third. Even though India's coal contains 
relatively little sulphur, coal combustion was the main source of SO2 emissions. Air pollution 
control technologies for thermal power plants, such as flue gas desulphurisation, are rarely 
deployed. The government has recently taken initial steps to rectify this by passing the 
Environmental Protection Amendment Rules (EPAR) Act. 
NOX emissions have grown slowly in recent years to just over 8 Mt in 2019. About 40% of 
these emissions stem from road transport, with nearly a further 30% from the power 
sector. Road transport activity increases with population density, and vehicle tailpipe 
emissions occur close to the ground, making urban NOX pollution particularly damaging to 
health.  
In the STEPS, existing policies to curb air pollution are implemented over time, and these 
limit the level of air pollution despite the rapid rate of population and economic growth 
over the period to 2040 (Figure 4.4). Increases in urban populations, however, mean that 
more people are exposed to higher concentration levels of air pollution and so annual 
premature deaths increase by 0.2 million to nearly 1.4 million in 2040, of which 60% are 
related to ambient air pollution (Figure 4.5). In the SDS, there is a much more substantial 
reduction in all air pollutants, meaning that the number of premature deaths in 2040 is 
more than 50% lower than in the STEPS. 

IndiaChinaAmbient air pollution
Sub-Saharan AfricaOtherHousehold air pollution
There were nearly 1.2 million premature deaths from air pollution in India in 2019. This 
number rises by 0.2 million to 2040 in the STEPS but falls by around 0.5 million in the SDS. 
 
There are divergent trends between sectors in air pollution emissions in the STEPS, 
depending on the stringency of existing and planned regulations.  
SO2 emissions fall by 44% between 2019 and 2040 in the STEPS. A 90% reduction in 
emissions from the power sector reflects full implementation of the EPAR, which means 
that the majority of coal-fired capacity is fitted with advanced desulphurisation control 
technology by 2030. However, neither current nor planned policies adequately monitor and 
regulate air pollutant emissions from the industry sector, particularly from small and 
medium enterprises. As a result, emissions of SO2 from industrial processes, which are only 
partially covered by existing or planned policies, increase by more than 80% over the 2019-
40 period, offsetting a quarter of the reductions in the power sector. NOX emissions in the 
STEPS fall by 15% between 2019 and 2040. Conventional vehicles sold after April 2020 are 
required to meet Bharat Stage VI emission standards, and the number of EVs increases, 
leading to a fall in road transport NOX emissions of 60% to 2040. However, NOX emissions 
from the industry sector grow by 90% over the same period. 
PM2.5 emissions in the STEPS increase by 4% through to 2040. Progress in access to clean 
cooking and heating technologies leads to a 40% reduction in PM2.5 emissions from the 
residential sector, but PM2.5 emissions from industrial facilities double over the period to 
2040, more than offsetting the reductions elsewhere. While some industrial facilities do use 
PM2.5 air pollution control technologies, there is a lack of effective regulation, and many 
others do not. 
In the SDS, air pollution policies are expanded to all sectors, including the combustion of 
fossil fuels in industry and industrial processes via advanced control technologies. There is 
also a rapid expansion of low-carbon energy technologies and a sharp reduction in coal-
fired power generation. As a result, power sector air pollutant emissions are almost entirely 
eliminated, and there is a much larger overall reduction in SO2 and NOX than in the STEPS. 
Universal access to clean cooking and heating technologies in the SDS lowers residential 
PM2.5 pollution to a negligible level from 2030. 
4.2.3 	CO2 emissions 
India's large and growing population, its low (but increasing) levels of energy consumption 
per capita and its high level of projected economic growth could all result in significant 
levels of future emissions, despite its relatively low per capita emissions today (see Chapter 
1). In the STEPS, CO2 emissions in India rebound quickly from the drop in 2020, and they 
exceed 2019 levels by 2022. There is a steady slowdown in the pace of growth over the 
period to 2040: emissions grow by 70 Mt per year between 2019 and 2030, by 60 Mt per 
year in the first half of the 2030s, and by 45 Mt per year in the second half. Total emissions 
in 2040 are around 50% greater than 2019 levels, although per capita CO2 emissions in 2040 
(2.4 t CO2 per capita) are still 40% lower than the global average at that time (4 t CO2 per 
capita). 
As part of the Paris Agreement, India included in its NDC a target to improve the emissions 
intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels and to achieve a 40% 
share of non-fossil fuels in electricity generation capacity by 2030. Both of these high-level 
targets are met in the STEPS: the emissions intensity of GDP in 2030 is 40% lower than in 
2005, and nearly 60% of India's electricity capacity in 2030 is non-fossil fuel. 
The power sector sees an especially large divergence from past CO2 emissions trends in the 
STEPS (Figure 4.6). Between 2019 and 2040, electricity demand increases by nearly 150% 
while emissions increase by 15%. The share of coal generation drops from just over 70% in 
2019 to less than 35% in 2040, while the share of renewables rises from 20% in 2019 to 
more than 55% in 2040. Power sector emissions grow slightly over the period to 2030 but 
then remain on a plateau thereafter.  
Figure 4.6 ? 	Changes in demand and CO2 emissions by sector in the STEPS 
 
 In the STEPS, activity and emissions diverge significantly in the power sector and the 
buildings sector to 2040; breaking these links is harder in industry and transport. 
 
Note: Activity variables: Power = electricity demand; buildings = residential floor space; industry = gross value 
added; transport = vehicle kilometres.  
The buildings sector also sees a loosening of the links between emissions and activity in the 
STEPS. Residential floor space almost triples between 2019 and 2040. There is also a big 
increase in electricity use in buildings, which expands by a factor of three between 2019 
and 2040. Electricity's share of total fuel use in buildings reaches nearly 50%, up from less 
than 20% today, reflecting an increasing level of appliance ownership. Ownership of air 
conditioners grows particularly rapidly. Despite this, emissions from residential buildings 
increase by less than 50%, and a similar pattern is observed in commercial and public 
buildings. New buildings are built to increasingly efficient designs, and major efforts are 
made to develop passive cooling systems. Policies that mandate minimum efficiency 
performance standards for air conditioners also help to curb some the increase in electricity 
demand that this would otherwise imply, while part of the growth in electricity demand 
comes at the expense of less efficient traditional biomass. 
There is less of a decoupling between activity and emissions in the industry sector. Cement 
production grows by 150% between 2019 and 2040, and emissions rise by 100%. A similar 
trend occurs in steelmaking. An increase in the use of natural gas helps keep emissions 
lower than they would otherwise be by displacing coal: the share of industry energy 
demand taken by natural gas more than doubles to 20% in 2040. Nevertheless, total CO2 
emissions from industry grow by more than 90% over the 2019-40 period. 
The growth in emissions from transport in the STEPS also remains closely linked to increases 
in activity. Total emissions from heavy-duty trucks nearly triple over this period as a result 
of increases in freight activity, although they are somewhat lower than they would 
otherwise be thanks to the average fuel consumption of heavy-duty trucks on the road in 
2040 being almost 20% lower than in 2019. There is also a substantial increase in emissions 
from passenger cars as ownership increases by a factor of five between 2019 and 2040. This 
is partly offset by a 30% improvement in the average fuel efficiency of passenger cars using 
internal combustion engines over the period to 2040, and by increasing sales of electric 
cars. In 2040, around 10% of the passenger cars and more than 50% of two- and three-
wheelers on the road are electric. Nonetheless, the growth in emissions from passenger 
cars accounts for around 40% of the total increase in transport sector emissions. 
Box 4.1 ? 	How do changes in emissions in India compare with other countries? 
Comparisons between the changes in CO2 emissions in India and in other countries need 
to be treated with caution. India is at a very different stage of development from many 
other economies, and it is set to experience rapid population and economic growth for 
many years to come. India's emissions per capita rank among the lowest in the world 
today, and it accounts for only about 3% of historic energy sector and industrial process 
CO2 emissions since 1850 (compared with around 30% for Europe, 25% the United 
States and around 15% for China). 
In the STEPS, CO2 emissions in India follow a different trajectory from that in most 
advanced economies, rising by 50% compared to 2019, to around 3.7 Gt CO2 over the 
period to 2040 (Figure 4.7). By 2040, India is the world's second-largest emitting country 
behind China, although China's emissions (more than 10 Gt CO2 in 2040) are markedly 
higher. Nonetheless, India's per capita emissions in 2040 (2.4 t CO2 per capita) remain 
far smaller than in most other countries, including the United States (9.5 t CO2 per 
capita), China (7.3 t CO2 per capita), and European countries (3.7 t CO2 per capita). In 
the IVC, emissions in India are slightly lower than in the STEPS, despite a higher level of 
economic growth. In the SDS, emissions in India fall by around 30% over the 2019-40 
period.  
An increasing number of countries and jurisdictions have announced targets or goals to 
achieve net-zero CO2 or GHG emissions. For example, the European Parliament and the 
European Council have endorsed a target to achieve net-zero GHG emissions in the 
European Union by 2050, and the Chinese government has announced a target to 
achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060. These targets are achieved in full in the SDS. 
These targets help to spur innovation and provide incentives for consumers and private 
actors to reduce emissions. They also provide a number of incentives to emissions 
reductions in India through lower costs for clean energy technologies and a much larger 
market for low-emissions products and services. In the SDS, India is on track to achieve 
net-zero emissions around the mid-2060s. 
 
Emissions in the IVC rise to a lesser extent than in the STEPS (Figure 4.8). In 2040, CO2 
emissions are around 450 Mt lower in the IVC than in the STEPS, despite stronger economic 
growth in the IVC and the achievement of universal access to energy. The biggest difference 
is seen in the industry sector, where CO2 emissions are around 260 Mt lower in 2040 in the 
IVC than in the STEPS. This stems mainly from a greater push for the use of more efficient 
technologies, which slows the increase in coal use, especially in the iron and steel sector. 
Emissions from the power sector in the IVC in 2040 are also around 100 Mt lower than in 
the STEPS; much of this is due to the greater growth in the IVC of the use of natural gas in 
place of coal-fired power, which peaks in the mid-2020s.  
The SDS charts a very different course for emissions than the STEPS (Figure 4.8). CO2 
emissions rebound slightly in 2021, but they never return to 2019 levels at any point in the 
outlook period. By 2030, emissions are around 5% lower than 2019 levels, and in 2040 they 
are nearly 30% lower. As a result, emissions in India in 2040 are around 1.1 t CO2 per capita, 
similar to levels in the mid-2000s. At a sectoral level, the largest differences between the 
STEPS and the SDS are in the power sector and industry, but there are also much stronger 
efforts to improve the efficiency of buildings and appliances in the SDS. Nearly 500 million 
people gain access to clean cooking solutions by 2040 in the SDS through the use of LPG, 
which leads to a small increase in CO2 emissions, though this would be more than offset by 
reductions in other GHGs (methane and nitrous oxide). 
In the power sector, emissions from coal-fired power plants fall by 90% between 2019 and 
2040 in the SDS. Renewables provide nearly 80% of electricity generation in 2040: 
generation from solar PV increases by more than 60 TWh every year on average to 2040, 
while wind generation grows by more than 35 TWh each year. In the SDS, around 40 GW of 
new solar PV is installed in India on average each year by 2040. To put it in another way, 
more capacity is added in a single year than was installed up to 2019. Around 15 GW of 
coal- and gas-fired power plants are also equipped with CCUS in 2040. 
Figure 4.8 ? 	Changes in CO2 emissions in India by scenario, 2019-2040 
 
In the STEPS, the industry and transport sectors lead emissions increases; in the SDS, these 
increases are more muted and there is a marked decline in power sector emissions. 
 
In the industry sector, coal use grows slightly to 2040 in the SDS, but at a much slower pace 
than in the STEPS. A number of industrial processes are fitted with CCUS to reduce 
emissions in the SDS, but enhanced efficiency measures play the most important part in 
curtailing the growth in industrial emissions. In the SDS, fuel use in industry is nearly 25% 
lower than in the STEPS, despite an identical level of economic output from the industry 
sector. Electricity also accounts for around one-quarter of total energy use in the industry in 
2040, compared with 20% in the STEPS. 
In transport, there is much more rapid growth in EVs in the SDS than in the STEPS: by 2040, 
60% of passenger cars and 40% of trucks on the road are electric. The use of sustainable 
biofuels and low-carbon gas and hydrogen-based fuels helps further to reduce the use of 
petroleum products in trucks, as well as in aviation and maritime shipping. Internal 
combustion engines are also around 40% more efficient in 2040 than today, reducing 
emissions from cars and trucks that continue to use them. Transport emissions nonetheless 
edge up marginally over the period to 2040.  
Figure 4.9 ? 	Energy sector CO2 emissions and reduction levers in the SDS 
 
 
	2010	2020	2030	2040	 
The enhanced deployment of renewables and efficiency causes CO2 emissions to peak in 
India in the SDS by 2030 and to decline steadily thereafter. 
 
4.2.4 	Managing potential trade-offs and synergies between the SDGs 
Charting a course towards achieving all of the SDGs in India in parallel is an immensely 
challenging undertaking. The relevant policies align in many respects, and there are a 
number of areas where synergies mean that progress towards one SDG can boost or 
support other goals. However, there remains a risk that progress in one area could hamper 
efforts elsewhere; energy transitions could for example have wider social impacts (Box 4.2). 
The course described in the SDS seeks to avoid or minimise trade-offs to the extent 
possible. 
Minimising potential trade-offs between the SDGs 
One example of potential trade-offs between policy goals comes in the transport sector. 
Electrification of road transport substantially reduces air pollution from this sector: a 
conventional car can emit more than 10 times the NOX produced by an electric car. 
However, if coal power plants without any pollution controls are used to generate the 
electricity for these vehicles, this would increase emissions of SO2. In this case, generating 
electricity for an electric car using coal would add about 18 times more SO2 emissions than 
using a conventional car (Figure 4.10). Implementation of the EPAR measures to reduce SO2 
emissions from power plants would help ensure that transport electrification leads to a 
reduction in all air pollutants. Conventional cars also produce CO2, and the emissions 
intensity of electricity needs to be less than 700 g CO2/kWh to 750 g CO2/kWh for new 
electric cars to result in fewer emissions than existing conventional passenger cars in India. 
The average emissions intensity of electricity in India is around this level today. In the 
STEPS, it falls to around 340 g CO2/kWh in 2040: if all EVs in 2040 were to be powered using 
electricity with this emissions intensity, this would lead to power sector emissions of 
around 45 Mt CO2.  
The oil displaced by EVs in the STEPS would avoid around 80 Mt CO2, meaning that there 
would be an overall reduction of around 35 Mt CO2 from the deployment of EVs. The exact 
level of savings would, however, depend on the precise time of vehicle charging as the 
emissions intensity of electricity in 2040 in the STEPS varies considerably throughout the 
day. It would be lowest during the daytime, when there is a large level of generation from 
solar PV, and highest at night-time, when coal power dominates the generation mix (see 
Chapter 3). Recharging electric cars during the daytime would therefore reduce the level of 
emissions coming from the power sector, and so further increase the overall level of 
savings.  
In the SDS, the average emissions intensity of electricity drops to around 60 g CO2/kWh in 
2040. Electric cars would therefore be significantly less emissions-intensive than 
conventional cars: powering all EVs in 2040 in the SDS with 60 g CO2/kWh electricity would 
lead to a net reduction of more than 150 Mt CO2. Again, savings could be even larger if 
vehicles were to be charged during the daytime.  
Figure 4.10 ? Emissions of CO2, NOX and SO2 from EVs in 2040 
 
Road transport electrification reduces CO2 and NOX emissions, but parallel changes in power 
generation are essential to eliminate potential rises in SO2 emissions.  
 
Notes: For CO2, analysis assumes EVs are powered with the average annual emissions intensity of electricity 
generation. For SO2, there are measures implemented in the SDS that reduce the sulphur content of gasoline 
and diesel to very low levels, so EVs displace slightly smaller quantities of SO2 than in the STEPS. 
Turning to another part of the energy sector, India has a target to convert around 100 Mt of 
coal to natural gas using coal gasification by 2030, which points to another potential 
tradeoff between air pollution and CO2 emissions. The use of natural gas in cities would 
reduce emissions of SOX and PM2.5, but coal gasification is a very CO2-emissions intensive 
way of producing natural gas. Achieving the government's target would lead to an 
additional 150 Mt CO2 emissions by 2030, compared with a case where the natural gas was 
produced from conventional reservoirs. CCUS offers a possible way of avoiding these 
additional emissions. 
Finally, the energy transition envisaged in the SDS requires an increase in investment 
expenditure compared with the STEPS: a cumulative increase of $1.4 trillion of investments 
in a wide range of clean energy technologies would be needed over the period 2019-40. To 
the extent that this relies on direct government expenditure, it would require increases in 
taxes, possibly including energy taxes, which could in turn increase end-user prices and risk 
damaging progress on energy access. This could be avoided by mobilising spending from 
private sources to ensure adequate investment for secure and sustainable energy 
transitions. As discussed in the next section, such mobilisation depends on improving 
effective regulatory procedures, reforming energy taxes and reducing risks for private 
investment.  
Box 4.2 ? 	The employment impacts of energy transitions 
A transformation of India's energy sector will inevitably have implications for 
employment as opportunities in cleaner energy and related sectors increase and jobs in 
traditional parts of the energy economy become scarcer. The changes involved will 
have a major impact on the lives of many people and communities, and they call for a 
strategic approach to secure a just transition with a strong focus on training and 
retraining.

Clean energy employment grows in all scenarios, especially in the SDS; the scale of the 
growth underlines the need for training and retraining. 
Across all scenarios, employment ramps up rapidly in grids and clean power generation, 
EV manufacturing, end-use efficiency and renewables, including in appliance 
manufacturing and the deployment of modern cook stoves (Figure 4.11). In the SDS, 
employment in these sectors grows notably higher than in the other scenarios, reaching 
1.6 million full-time equivalent jobs, largely due to substantial increases in employment 
in EV manufacturing and in efficiency. In the SDS, strategic decisions taken early to limit 
growth in conventional manufacturing segments minimise the need for retraining and 
later retooling of manufacturing lines. The IVC relies heavily on renewable generation 
and batteries, and employment levels in those areas are comparable to those in SDS.  
The location of these jobs is an important factor for managing transitions, especially 
when directing programmes and funding. Jobs in construction and delivery of retrofits 
have a relatively even geographic distribution: retrofits can be performed wherever 
there are buildings. Manufacturing and mining jobs, however, are geographically 
specific, and are often vitally important to the local area. For example, coal is mostly 
produced in the poorer states of India today, and coal extraction is the main economic 
activity in several regions. In the SDS, there is an 85% reduction in coal-fired power 
generation and a 60% reduction in domestic coal mining between 2019 and 2040. This 
would inevitably entail large job losses among the roughly 500 000 official workers who 
depend on the industry, and more among informal workers. Unless carefully managed, 
this could have major social and economic implications in local economies and 
communities. 
There is much that could be done to support those who would be affected. For 
example, regions where jobs are lost due to the energy transition could be focal regions 
for investments in emerging sectors, such as battery production, and funding could be 
provided for environmental restoration in mining regions, which could provide near-
term employment for those approaching retirement as others are retrained. A 
comprehensive communication strategy, together with well-resourced reskilling and 
regional revitalisation programmes, would be essential to enable workers in incumbent 
industries to find alternative livelihoods (IEA, 2020b). Retraining programmes should be 
informed by a process of mapping skills between displaced and growing occupational 
segments requiring similar skill sets (ILO, 2011).  
Identifying and maximising synergies 
There is a great deal of potential for synergies between improving energy access and 
reducing air pollution. In 2019, there were around 600 000 premature deaths associated 
with household air pollution in India, most of which were associated with traditional uses of 
biomass for cooking. Achieving full access to clean cooking solutions by 2030, as in both the 
IVC and the SDS, reduces this to fewer than 100 000 deaths in 2030.  
Reducing the traditional use of bioenergy for cooking would also reduce GHG emissions. 
The majority of people gaining access to clean cooking achieve this through the use of LPG. 
While the achievement of clean cooking for all would lead to an increase in CO2 emissions, 
this would be more than offset in terms of overall GHG emissions by a reduction in 
methane and nitrous oxide emissions arising from the traditional uses of biomass (Figure 
4.12). More clean cooking with LPG could also reduce deforestation and other 
environmental and water stresses that are often associated with the collection of biomass 
and charcoal.  
There is also a great deal of scope for synergies between reducing GHG emissions and 
achieving other sustainability objectives. For example, greater use of renewables would 
reduce emissions, and would at the same time reduce water stress (Box 4.3). 
Figure 4.12 ? Changes in GHG emissions from providing clean cooking by scenario, 
2019-2040 
 
Higher CO2 emissions from increased LPG consumption for access in the IVC are more than 
offset by a reduction in other GHGs, notably methane, from the traditional use of biomass. 
 
Note: CO2-eq = carbon dioxide equivalent. 
Box 4.3 ? 	Reducing water needs in the power sector 
India's power sector withdrew over 20 bcm of water and consumed more than 3 bcm in 
2019, almost all of it used for cooling and washing in coal power plants.  Yet almost 
35% of India's coal power plant capacity that uses freshwater cooling is located in areas 
that are categorised as extremely water stressed, and a further 16% is in areas 
experiencing high water stress.   
India has put in place a number of measures to reduce levels of water withdrawal. All 
existing and new thermal power plants are required to switch to tower cooling 
technologies and to cap their water consumption, and plants located within a 50 km 
radius of municipal sewage treatment plants are required to use treated sewage water. 
Nevertheless, just 8% of all coal plants in India have access to treated wastewater and 
are able to use it completely or partially to meet their cooling water needs; there are also water 
quality challenges and competition from other uses, such as irrigation.  
To alleviate water stress further, operators could improve power plant efficiency, deploy dry 
cooling plants, retrofit existing plants to use dry cooling, and make better use of non-fresh 
water and water recycling.  
A number of low-carbon energy options - most notably nuclear, bioenergy and concentrating 
solar power - also require access to water and could be limited by water availability in the 
future. Decisions about plant locations and cooling technology options therefore need to take 
into account water availability and competing water demands. 
The STEPS sees a significant decrease in water withdrawals to 8 bcm in 2040 as a result of 
increases in the share of electricity coming from use of renewables and regulations on water 
use in thermal power plants (Figure 4.13). However, water consumption grows by 65% to 
2040 as a result of India's policy for all thermal power plants to use tower cooling.  
The SDS sees water withdrawals fall to less than 3 bcm in 2040, reflecting a major reduction in 
coal-fired power generation. The decline in coal-fired generation also means that water 
consumption falls by around 40% to 2040, although this is offset slightly by increases in 
consumption from modern forms of biomass, nuclear and concentrating solar power.

4.3 	Clean energy investment and finance 
India currently devotes nearly 3% of its GDP to energy investment, and an increasing share 
of this investment is going into clean energy.  This clearly represents an investment 
opportunity, but it is one that comes at a time of increased economic uncertainty and new 
risks. The pandemic has disrupted supply chains, weakened state discoms, and undermined 
access to finance, adding new challenges to persistent underlying structural issues. Despite 
this, interest in investing in India's clean energy transition remains high, as evidenced by a 
record level of awards of solar PV tenders and by the response of policies, such as Delhi's 
new EV scheme. 
India's investment response to the pandemic has so far focused on short-term measures to 
ease liquidity and support project development. Efforts to navigate a rapidly changing 
market situation while addressing longer-term issues will determine how the outlook 
evolves over the next decade. Mobilising investments will depend on improving the 
availability of finance from a diverse range of actors and instruments, and that in turn will 
depend in part on appropriate long-term policy design.  
4.3.1 	Investment needs under different energy pathways 
Under any energy pathway, India's energy system would require a significant amount of 
investment and a shift towards clean energy and grids. At nearly $160 billion, annual 
spending in STEPS reaches double the level of the past five years by 2030. Half of this 
growth comes from power, led by grids, renewables and battery storage. Spending 
continues for fossil fuel-based power, supported by plants under construction, but the level 
of expenditure steps down to much lower levels by 2030. Investment in fuel supply grows 
modestly for oil and gas and biofuels in STEPS, and declines for coal by 2030. There is also a 
significant rise in support for purchases of EVs, whose sales top 8 million in 2030, as well as 
for investment in efficiency and renewable heating applications.  
The SDS sees a level of investment by 2030 that is 35% higher than in the STEPS, and three 
times greater than that during 2015 to 2020 (Figure 4.14). Over 90% of the annual $200 
billion in the SDS from 2025-30 goes to clean energy and electricity networks, up from 60% 
over the past five years. Renewables-based power investment, led by solar PV and wind, 
triples to almost $50 billion a year, supported by a doubling of spending on electricity grids. 
System flexibility and emissions reductions are further supported by higher levels of 
investment in battery storage, as well as by increases in gas-fired power, hydropower and 
nuclear power.  
Investment in the direct use of renewables in buildings, industry and transport, especially 
bioenergy and biofuels, also rises in the SDS, reaching over $10 billion annually. Spending 
increases to over $10 billion by 2030 on the electrification of the vehicle fleet too, bringing 
about an acceleration of EV sales to 12 million annually on average from 2025 to 2030, 70% 
of which are two- and three-wheeled vehicles, as well as a rapid roll-out of charging 
infrastructure. This is all enabled by more stringent consumption measures and investment 
in energy management systems, more efficient appliances and new industrial motors. 
Overall energy productivity increases by 55% in the SDS, led by improvements in the energy 
intensity of commercial buildings and of key industrial sectors such as cement and steel. By 
2030, investment in CCUS starts to support emissions reductions in heavy industry and coal 
power, while investment in new unabated coal power dips to near zero by mid-decade.  
Figure 4.14 ? Annual average clean energy-related investment and activity indicators 
by sector in the SDS 
 
To meet sustainability goals, more than 90% of India's energy investment in the SDS goes to 
clean energy and grids, with sizeable allocations of capital for renewables and efficiency.  
 
Notes: RE = renewable energy. Energy efficiency is shown as gains in energy productivity (economic output 
per unit of consumption). The 2025-30 time period is used as an indicative post-recovery benchmark. 
The role of investment frameworks and the industry and financial landscape 
Mobilising capital will depend first on strengthening the enabling frameworks for 
investment and addressing cross-cutting factors, notably those pertaining to country risks 
(the macroeconomic situation, particularly currency volatility) and policy and regulatory 
risks (investors point to issues over "contract certainty" - the combination of contract 
sanctity and policy certainty - as a key challenge). Other cross-cutting risks include 
burdensome and slow administrative processes for obtaining project permits, rigid labour 
regulations, difficulties associated with land acquisition and the relatively low level of 
availability of longterm, fixed-rate debt (Table 4.2). 
The investment outlook also depends on the type of companies developing projects and the 
way they manage risks and capital budgets. PSUs are the main financiers of electricity grids 
and are subject to price regulation risk (tariffs revised periodically by the regulator), while 
investors in utility-scale renewables obtain a price for electricity that is agreed up front and 
set in a long-term contract. However, India's electricity discoms are subject to cash flow 
and performance risks that have knock-on effects for the rest of the system, including 
transmission companies and privately owned generators who remain dependent on reliable 
dispatching, balancing and payments. Timely investment in any part of the energy system is 
to a large extent dependent on all parts of the energy system performing at an adequate 
level.  
MSMEs, ESCOs, households 
Note: PSUs = public sector undertakings, state-owned enterprises, majority-owned by the central or state 
governments. MSMEs = micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, ESCOs = energy service companies. 
At nearly $85 billion in 2019 (see Chapter 1), energy accounts for around 10% of investment 
in India. Large, domestically listed energy supply companies play an important role in 
funding the sector: they account for nearly half of energy investment (Figure 4.15). The 
other half of energy investment comes from unlisted state-owned companies (e.g. discoms) 
and private actors, such as MSMEs, individual households and, to a lesser extent, 
international companies.  
PSUs are likely to play a continued important role over the next decade, accounting for 
around 30% of the ownership of new energy capital over 2025-2030 in the SDS. While 2020 
energy investment declined by around 15%, the government is pressing PSUs to meet initial 
capital budgeting targets in order to sustain employment. Spending is set to decline in the 
fossil fuel sectors where they are most prominent, but PSUs also account for over 80% of 
investment in electricity grids over the period. Many PSUs face increased financial strain as 
a result of the crisis, however, and this is affecting their ability to invest and serve as 
creditworthy purchasers from private players. Some PSUs are making efforts to diversify: 
NTPC has signalled a shift towards investing in solar PV to increase its renewable power 
generation capacity up to 25% by 2032, and Indian Railways - a major consumer - has 
announced a net-zero emissions target by 2030.  
Around 70% of clean energy-related investment will be met by private sources; public 
finance and policy design are critical to mobilise capital to meet diverse financing needs. 
 
Notes: Petrol. = petroleum; ONGC = Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited. The ownership projections are 
based on estimates of the share of investment that is carried out by state-owned enterprises and 
government sponsors (public sources) compared with that led by private actors. 
Some large private actors have also increased their clean energy ambitions. Reliance 
Industries has announced a 2035 net-zero target, and other energy supply companies (e.g. 
Tata Group, Adani Transmission, Suzlon and Essar Oil and Gas) have committed to set 
emissions reduction goals under the Declaration of the Private Sector on Climate Change, 
though implementation details are not yet available. Automotive companies in India plan to 
spend around $500 million in support of EV deployment in the next few years. An increased 
emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is also starting to influence 
disclosure and strategies. Among the top listed companies, over half report ESG data, 
though only around 5% disclose details on how capital expenditure aligns with sustainability 
goals. 
We estimate that 70% of investment over the next decade in sectors critical to meeting the 
SDS would need to come from privately-owned projects, which are set to play an important 
part in scaling up renewables, efficiency and new technologies. In recent years, clean 
energy investments have been carried out more by newer and less well capitalised 
companies, raising questions over their ability to fund the transition. In some sectors, the 
industry has become more mature: in utility-scale solar PV and wind, there has been a shift 
towards fewer large developers with greater risk-taking capacity, which has helped projects 
to access lower cost funding (IEA/CEEW, 2020). However, clean energy sectors generally 
still lack scale and diversified access to financing. Some investments in efficiency are carried 
out by large, established companies, but others are made by MSMEs and smaller ESCOs. 
Much of the investment in clean energy is also likely to come through unlisted companies 
that face barriers in raising funding from capital markets. Foreign direct investment and 
enhancement of domestic sources are both key to meeting financing needs.  
Viewed from this perspective, India's financial system development lags behind that in 
many other emerging market and developing economies, and doubts about the availability 
of finance puts a question mark against future investment plans (Figure 4.16). In 2020, both 
debt and equity market risk premiums increased in the first half of the year, reflecting 
capital outflows amid the pandemic, and offsetting some of the moderating effect from 
more expansive monetary policy and central bank liquidity support. As a result, the 
economy-wide cost of capital in India remains high, with risks to the upside in the event of 
potential further economic fallout. 
Figure 4.16 ? India's financial system development (left) and clean energy investment in 
the SDS by financing instrument, 2025-2030 (right) 
 
Private credit and stock market (share of GDP)  
A diverse range of equity and debt instruments is needed to fund clean energy-related 
investment in the SDS, and access to finance represents a potential barrier to meeting 
sustainability goals.  
 
Notes: Instruments estimates are based on current observed capital structures by sector, derived from 
financing data on companies and consumers (for balance sheet financing) and assets (for project finance), 
applied to SDS investment projections; equity includes grants.  
On the equity side, economy-wide required rates of return are generally high, at around 
15%, reflecting cross-cutting risks to investing but also the underdevelopment of capital 
markets. Stock market capitalisation as a share of GDP stands at nearly 65%, compared with 
the global weighted average of over 100%. India is effective at bringing new companies to 
market in terms of initial public offerings (IPOs), though relatively few equity market listings 
have been in the energy sector. Since 2015, industrial sectors have accounted for around 
45% of IPOs, and consumer firms such as automotive, retail and textile companies for a 
further 30%; less than 10% of IPOs were for energy-related companies (mostly renewables 
companies). 
Debt financing largely comes from a mixture of domestic banks and non-banking financial 
companies, such as the Power Finance Corporation (Figure 4.17). The average of private 
credit and stock market capitalisation as a share of GDP stands around 60%, compared with 
a global average of around 100%. While long-tenure debt is generally available for 
renewable power, regulatory rules on sector lending mean that renewables compete for 
the same pool of bank capital as thermal power, where an increase in stressed assets has 
put pressure on bank lending (see below). Debt is more constrained on the consumer side: 
only around 15% of MSMEs have formal access to credit, and many rely instead on the 
more expensive and less transparent informal market for lending. While MSMEs are 
recognised as a priority lending sector, there are no sectoral lending requirements for 
efficiency. 
Figure 4.17 ? Sustainable debt issuance and types of issuers in India 
 
India is one of the largest emerging market issuers of sustainable debt. Although issuance 
has not grown in recent years, it remained resilient in 2020.  
 

Meeting India's clean energy investment needs over the next decade will require a financial 
system that can better match the capital needs of energy companies and assets. The closer 
that India moves towards an SDS pathway, the more investment needs will increase, and 
the more important the availability of debt finance will become. A shift from investment in 
fuels to investment in the electricity sector will increase investment requirements; 
additional investment will also be needed in end-use sectors. Debt shares within these 
sectors in India are lower than in advanced economies, however, pointing to a need to 
develop domestic credit markets to support lower-cost financing.  
Attracting greater shares of debt depends on addressing the sector-level issues described 
below, as well as reforming sectoral lending rules, deepening corporate bond markets and 
fostering markets for new instruments. Better availability of default protection and 
risktransfer mechanisms would help enhance corporate borrowing (CPI, 2020). Sustainable 
debt issuance has surged globally, and India is one of the largest emerging market issuer of 
green bonds, except for China. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, sustainable debt issuance in 
India remained resilient in 2020, supported mostly by energy companies and utilities. Over 
90% of proceeds went to renewable power, with a smaller share to low-carbon transport. If 
it is to scale up, the market is likely to require more integrated frameworks for 
measurement, verification and reporting, and more diversity in issuers. The creation of a 
sustainable finance taxonomy, based on a list of green economic activities, could support 
this. There is also scope for warehousing projects into securities, such as infrastructure and 
real estate investment trusts (INVITs and REITs), which spread risks and transaction costs. 
4.3.2 	Key issues and success factors for financing clean energy transitions  
Whichever way India's energy sector evolves from here, the scale of the country's energy 
investment needs is huge, especially in the power and end-use sectors. In the second part 
of this section, we zoom in on four issues that are critical to the prospects for a more 
sustainable and secure energy sector: 
the financial performance of the state electricity discoms 
the question of how to scale up investment in utility-scale renewable projects 
the different approaches required to finance efficiency improvements, transport 
electrification and smaller-scale clean energy projects 
the linkages with existing, often poorly performing investments in other parts of India's 
energy sector. 
Improving the financial performance of state distribution companies 
State electricity discoms represent the biggest financial uncertainty in the value chain of 
India's power sector investment. These utilities suffer from persistent revenue shortfalls, in 
large part due to poor operational performance in billing of power, difficulties in collection 
of sales from consumers, and high levels of aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) 
losses. Performance varies widely by state but overall, outstanding dues to generation 
companies climbed from nearly $4 billion in September 2017 to over $18 billion in 
September 2020 (PFC Consulting, 2020). The situation affects the ability of utilities to invest 
in the expansion and modernisation of grids, honour contracts with renewable and thermal 
generators, and integrate clean energy technologies, such as distributed resources, that 
may affect their top-line revenues. As described above, uncertainty over power purchase 
remains a critical risk for project developers, challenging efforts to manage the cost of 
energy transitions. 
In 2015, the government launched the UDAY initiative in an effort to improve discom 
finances. This involved state governments writing off up to 75% of their debt and 
restructuring the remaining loans with a concessional interest rate of only 10 basis points 
over the central bank's base rate. While UDAY has reduced debt burdens, it has not 
translated into dramatic improvements in key performance indicators that would denote 
improved profitability. Recent annual data show the average cost of electricity supply 
remaining 8% higher than revenues, an imbalance that has only modestly improved over 
the past three years. The pandemic has not helped: discoms experienced a 15% reduction 
in demand during March-June compared with the same period in 2019, mostly due to 
corporate and industrial power users, and this has translated into $3 billion to $4 billion in 
lost revenues. In March 2020, the central government announced a liquidity scheme of $13 
billion to help reduce outstanding dues to generators.  
Revenue shortfalls for state discoms have led to significant arrears to generators; better 
performance on key indicators would help enhance profitability. 
 
Notes: Performance is calculated based on billing, collecting and AC&T losses rates. Current value is 
estimated at 63% (85% billing rate, 93% collection rate and 21% AC&T losses). Improvements in key 
performance indicators are assumed to benefit each consumer category (domestic, commercial, agricultural, 
industrial and others) pro rata with its sales. 

Narrowing the cost-revenue gap is critical to enhancing financial performance and clearing 
the backlog of overdue payments. Three-quarters of discom income stems from sales to 
consumers, 15% from tariff subsidies and 3% from revenue grants under UDAY. Around 
80% of their expenses come from the cost of power purchase and generation, with the 
remainder from administrative, labour and financing costs. Power costs are determined by 
the mix of generation, fuel costs and provisions under long-term PPAs, and revenues are 
influenced by tariff structures and demand.  
While larger energy market and policy developments will inevitably have a big impact on 
the cost-revenue gap, utilities can make important strides towards profitability by focusing 
efforts on improving billing efficiency, collection efficiency, and reducing AT&C losses. We 
estimate that discoms were able to monetise only 63% of the electricity they distributed in 
2020 due to difficulties in these areas. Raising this to 75% or more would bring them back 
to profitability (Figure 4.18).  
Such improvements may require increased investment and operational measures geared 
towards metering, billing and collection systems as well as the upgrade and monitoring of 
distribution grids to reduce losses. However, while distribution companies could improve 
business profitability by taking such measures, their efforts would be enhanced by better 
governance and by structural reforms. Such reforms might include government action to 
improve the cost-reflectiveness of tariffs, increase the share of low-cost renewables, and 
address the financial implications of existing thermal power assets (see below). They might 
also extend to opening the distribution segment up to competition, in line with government 
plans to privatise utilities in union territories. 
Mobilising investment for utility-scale renewables projects 
Investment in renewable power grew by almost 55% between 2014 and 2019, and interest 
in investing remains strong, as evidenced by the high level of solar PV bids (15 GW) in the 
first half of 2020, even if no wind capacity was awarded in the first half of 2020. While this 
solar PV tendering was influenced by the exercise of a large (8 GW) option awarded under a 
previous manufacturing-linked tender, the rest of the capacity awarded during the first half 
of 2020 topped that from the first half of 2019, and was 75% higher than in the first half of 
2018.  
The impacts of the economic crisis nonetheless add additional layers of risk to the massive 
scaling-up of investment that would be needed in the IVC or SDS. Meeting the ambitious 
2030 target for renewable electricity would require adding more than 30 GW of renewable 
capacity each year between 2020 and 2030, and this has a much better chance of 
happening if action is taken to address persistent risks around power purchase, land 
acquisition and availability of transmission, as well as policy and regulatory uncertainties, 
such as those related to potential new trade measures for solar PV.  
At the same time, financing terms for projects, and the risk and return proposition facing 
developers, have begun to shift, as illustrated in analysis from IEA and CEEW on tender 
results over 2019 to mid-2020 (IEA/CEEW, 2020). On the project debt side, availability and 
pricing have remained stable, with differences mainly due to off-taker risks. Long tenors 
(16-18 years) and high debt ratios (around 75%) remain the norm. On the equity side, the 
estimated equity internal rate of return (EIRR; i.e. the minimum return required by equity 
holders) for solar PV projects stood at around 15% on a weighted average basis (by 
awarded capacity) over the course of 2019 and the first half of 2020, with differences 
depending on off-taker risks and type of site.  
For example, while expectations of returns for projects with central off-takers and Gujarat 
distribution companies were similar, they were 80-200 basis points higher where the state 
utility off-taker presented higher credit risk. Competition in tenders has also been an 
important determinant of return expectations. In the first half of 2019, bids far outpaced 
tendered capacity, helping keep EIRRs down around 14%. However, from the second half of 
the year through mid-2020, returns rose to 16-17% (Figure 4.19), in the face of new policy 
and market uncertainty-such as potential renegotiation of contracts or the imposition and 
extension of duties on solar PV imports. The increased interest in the first half of 2020 may 
have been due to greater innovation in tenders or measures such as granting letters of 
credit.  

EIRR expectations for solar PV projects stood at around 15% over the course of 2019 and the 
first half of 2020, with differences depending on off-taker risks and type of site. 

While developments over the past few years point to the ongoing maturity and improved 
competitiveness of the Indian renewables industry, the scaling-up of investment would be 
materially assisted by efforts to address persistent risks so as to bring generation costs 
more in line with global best case benchmarks. In the first half of 2020, the average price of 
tendered solar PV (weighted by capacity) was twice that of the best levels achieved in 
Europe. 
In a survey of key investors, financiers and analysts, the key differences identified related to 
risks around power purchase (delays in payment by off-takers); contract renegotiation 
(offtakers seeking to renegotiate PPAs); land acquisition (concerns around availability, 
pricing, permitting and ownership); finance (limited availability of long-term, fixed-rate 
debt, and high cost); and regulatory uncertainty (lack of clarity in some laws and 
regulations, and fear of changes). Power purchase and renegotiation risks - both part of the 
off-taker risk category - are most prominent when the counterparty is a state discom with a 
weak financial and operational performance. The availability of grid connections and 
equipment supply chains are also important factors (Figure 4.20). 
Figure 4.20 ? Awarded prices in new utility-scale solar PV tenders in India versus 
benchmark by risks (left) and financial measures (right) 
 
measures 
Off-taker risks are the most significant perceived risks for solar PV projects in India today; 
policy reforms, debt solutions and guarantees could help address these risks.  
 
Note: Awarded prices in India correspond to the average price discovered in solar PV tenders in the first half 
of 2020 (weighted by capacity). The best case corresponds to average prices discovered in solar PV tenders in 
Portugal and Spain over the period. Guarantees refer to financial guarantees provided by third parties. 
Policy efforts are now being made to address issues around grid integration, land 
acquisition and the promotion of domestic manufacturing. Reaching the 450 GW target by 
2030 will require a much more flexible system, with increased investments in grids and 
storage, a stronger focus on demand-side measures, and tenders that provide appropriate 
compensation for flexibility services provided to the system. Around 60% of the projects 
awarded in the first half of 2020 incorporate new arrangements, for example by allowing 
hybrid wind and solar PV, or projects bundled with domestic solar PV manufacturing 
capacity. SECI, a central government counterparty, has also introduced tenders with 
storage.  
New business models and progress in other renewable segments may also improve 
riskreturn propositions, but this too depends on ongoing reforms. Although around 90% of 
today's power supply is delivered through bilateral long-term contracts (IEA, 2020c), Indian 
authorities are discussing ways of expanding a wholesale market for trading power across 
India, including least-cost dispatch of electricity, which could lead to projects taking on a 
higher degree of merchant risk. Globally, a number of corporations contract power directly 
from renewable generators, as a way of meeting green purchasing goals and locking in 
lowcost power supply. Solar PV based on corporate PPAs have, however, reduced 
considerably in India in 2020 - despite considerable growth in previous years. Reforms 
could lead to greater utilisation of forward contracts to increase the options for hedging, 
which are currently not available in India.  
Overall, scaling up investment for utility-scale renewable projects will require policy 
reforms, as well as an expansion of the availability of low-cost financing. Policy and 
regulatory certainty that allows investors and financiers to price risks effectively remains a 
key condition. Targeted financial measures, especially those aimed at debt structuring, 
credit enhancement and guarantees, could further help to address off-taker and finance-
related risks. Madhya Pradesh has adopted a three-tier payment security mechanism to 
address purchase risks, for example, and this kind of mechanism could be adopted more 
widely. The ability to access loans for longer periods and on more flexible repayment terms 
that better match project cash flows will become more critical as tenders become more 
complex. In all these areas, development finance institutions have the potential to play a 
key financing role, but long lead times and stringent conditions can blunt their 
effectiveness. Expanding the suite of off-takers through better frameworks for corporate 
PPAs could also be helpful.  
Financing energy efficiency, electrification of transport and small-scale clean energy 
Over the next decade, the energy intensity of commercial buildings declines by over 
onethird in the SDS while the fuel economy of passenger cars improves by 40% compared 
with the previous five years. These goals are supported by investments in more efficient 
lighting, cooling and appliances, as well as uptake of EVs and in charging infrastructure. 
Investment in distributed renewables, including solar PV and solar thermal, tops $14 billion 
by 2030 compared with $2 billion in 2020.  
Much of the investment in the SDS would be for smaller-scale resources, and investment 
models for such resources differ considerably from those for bulk power assets. They rely to 
some extent on the balance sheets of consumers, MSMEs, real estate developers and 
ESCOs, and are often not able to adopt long-term contracts. Remuneration frequently 
depends on energy savings against retail tariffs, which differ considerably among consumer 
classes. They also depend to a large extent on equity. Over half of buildings-related 
investment, and nearly 70% of transport investments, will be financed with equity over 
2025-30; investments in utility-scale power and in more developed markets will make more 
use of debt. Mobilising investment depends on improving returns and financing costs, but 
changing energy prices and higher market risk premiums are currently extending payback 
periods and reducing profitability for key efficiency investments. Efforts to improve 
financing could help (Figure 4.20), but increasing the pipeline of bankable efficiency 
projects depends on stronger policy frameworks and greater standardisation of financial 
models with projections of energy savings and monitoring and verification protocols. 
Investment in distributed generation, including rooftop solar PV and mini-grids, could help 
improve electricity services while taking some financial pressure off discoms. Integrating 
distributed applications with agriculture or other uses could similarly help to relieve subsidy 
burdens and lower technical losses. The current tariff system does not, however, provide 
sufficient incentive for utilities to adopt supportive frameworks, in part due to fear that 
providing such incentives would risk their losing revenues from more profitable industrial 
consumers. Industry sources point to consumer-owned installations as more common than 
those leased or made on a PPA basis with third parties, although some investment has been 
supported by auctions for government off-takers. Captive power users and MSMEs 
represent a large potential market, but often face credit constraints and lack suitable 
collateral. Domestic lending capacity has been reinforced by development financing, with 
preferential lines of credit earmarked by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank in 
collaboration with local banks, but an acceleration in investment has yet to be seen.

 Changing energy prices and a higher cost of capital have reduced profit expectations for 
efficiency measures; better access to finance would improve the investment case.  
 
Notes: NPV = net present value; bps = basis points. Changes in cost of capital in 2020 reflect movements in 
the economy-wide risk-free rate and equity- and debt-market risk premiums, weighted by capital structure. 
Equity share assumptions = air conditioner, 100%; industrial motor, 75%; electric car and two-/three-
wheeler, 70%. 
For buildings efficiency and distributed generation, bundling assets to achieve scale is one 
route to securing investment. Construction of green buildings has emerged as another 
fastgrowing mechanism for obtaining investment: in 2020, nearly 1 billion m2 was certified 
as green, which is equivalent to 5% of total residential floor space. Efficiency upgrades can 
increase building valuations, but the benefits are not easy to monetise without 
independent ratings systems to verify and communicate performance to stakeholders 
(including current and future owners and tenants). The capital structure of real estate 
developers mostly relies on relatively costly equity. Access to finance remains a constraint 
for these developers, particularly those at the smaller end of the scale, and no dedicated 
finance facility for the sector exists (World Bank, 2018). Incentives to integrate smart 
energy management systems, government procurement of efficient equipment and 
appliances, and reduced administrative hurdles for code-compliant investments would all 
help support the business case for efficiency.  
Targeted financial solutions, such as credit enhancement, could better encourage 
investment in projects serving MSMEs. One study has assessed that the provision of credit 
guarantees to local banks to support lending to developers could increase private 
investment in rooftop solar PV by up to 14 times (CPI, 2018). In recent years, domestic 
lending capacity has been reinforced by development financing, including preferential lines 
of credit to encourage lower-risk on-lending to distributed sectors. The pooling of real 
estate assets into marketable securities - through REITs or INVITS - can also support 
reinvestment by developers and reduce reliance on banks, but action is needed to address 
regulatory and taxation uncertainties.  
In transport, improving financial options for drivers will be critical. Two-thirds of the 
increase in EV sales in the SDS comes from two- and three-wheelers. Most three-wheeler 
(autorickshaw) operators lease their vehicle, paying the owners daily from their earnings. 
Owning an electric auto-rickshaw outright might well make more economic sense for such 
operators, but it is often hard for them to gain access to finance because of a track record 
of high default rates on loans for such rickshaws (in part due to the initially unreliable 
performance of leadacid batteries), the small size of the loans that are sought and a lack of 
collateral on the part of the operators (EVreporter, 2020). Incomes for drivers have suffered 
during the pandemic, making lenders even more cautious about extending finance. 
Dedicated loan products and buy-back schemes for existing vehicles could help to support 
investment. 
Box 4.4 ? 	Mobilising investment through service models and securitisation 
The provision of energy as a service is growing, and this is helping to boost investment 
in distributed resources and efficiency in India. Some 150 private ESCOs are now 
accredited by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, and their numbers have tripled over the 
past decade. They play particularly important roles in industrial sectors, where their use 
of performance contracting helps to attract credit from banks. Around 90% of the 
arrangements made by private ESCOs in industry involve energy performance contracts 
(EPC) based on shared savings; the remainder take the form of EPCs with guaranteed 
savings (IEA, 2018). These contracts are reinforced by a Partial Risk Guarantee Fund 
established by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, which has mobilised private capital at a 
rate of over three times the level of public commitment. 
The government is also trying to cultivate a market for energy services supported by the 
state-owned "super ESCO", Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), which has used its 
balance sheet and development bank funding to become the largest developer of 
smallscale clean energy, investing nearly $0.2 billion annually over 2017 and 2018 in 
areas such as lighting, smart meters and buildings. It seeks to increase its spending to 
over $0.8 billion annually, partly in support of setting up EV charging stations. EESL also 
aims to bolster bulk procurement programmes, such as the successful UJALA LED 
initiative, to support lower-cost appliance purchases by consumers.

Despite rapid growth, India's energy service market faces organisational and financial 
constraints, while progress on asset aggregation and securitisation remains limited.  
Notes: ABS = asset-backed securities; MBS = mortgage-backed securities. Organisational capability 
corresponds to ESCO grades assessed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency.  Sources: IEA analysis based on 
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (2020) and VKC (2019).  
Despite rapid growth, only 5% of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency assessed efficiency 
market has been tapped by ESCOs. This is due in part to insufficient policy signals and 
lack of standardisation around savings and contractual frameworks, and in part to 
constraints in balance sheets, which have deteriorated during the economic crisis. 
While some ESCOs are part of larger private companies or public entities, most are 
independent players with limited organisational capability and access to finance (Figure 
4.22). Creditworthy clients have been reluctant to engage, and large industries have yet 
to show strong interest in performance contracting and energy service models. Banks 
have nonetheless been willing to lend to projects that are viable, even without the 
support of guarantee funds (BEE, 2018). 
Infusions of both equity and debt are needed in the sector. New business models 
focused on providing system and end-user services beyond efficiency could help attract 
risk capital (AEEE, 2017). The promotion of warehousing and securitisation, which 
aggregate loans, receivables or projects and issue them as listed securities, could 
support lowercost refinancing and free up balance sheets for reinvestment. This 
practice has accelerated globally with the issuance of green MBS and Property Assessed 
Clean Energy loans in the United States, but the securitisation market has yet to take 
off properly in India. Better certification, more credit enhancement options for projects 
and the establishment of a state-backed pooling intermediary could help enhance such 
a market.  The emissions reductions seen in the SDS compared with the STEPS in 
industry - including in steel, cement, chemical and manufacturing - require a reduction 
in energy intensity by around a quarter over the next decade. The investments that 
would be necessary to make this happen mostly focus on efficiency, but they also 
include funding for the direct use of renewables, such as bioenergy and solar thermal 
(the market for which has rapidly expanded to around $1 billion in 2019), as well as for 
gas and electricity to substitute for coal. These goals come at a time when the 
government is prioritising domestic manufacturing. Threequarters of industry 
investment depends on equity, and there is potential to diversify funding sources and 
attract more debt to reduce the cost of capital.  
The PAT scheme - a market-based mechanism with efficiency targets and tradeable energy 
savings certificates - provides the main incentive to invest. PAT Cycle 1 resulted in 
investments of around $4 billion, mostly from large companies, and its targets were met in 
all sectors except for thermal power. Incentives remain volatile, however, with energy 
savings certificate pricing varying considerably in recent years, in part owing to an excess of 
supply. Moreover, the PAT scheme to date has largely excluded the MSME sector. The 
Atmanirbhar Bharat Scheme is now making available collateral-free debt ($42 billion) and 
subordinated debt ($6 billion) to businesses and stressed MSMEs. Improving funding 
options could be enhanced through better domestic corporate bond markets, as well as 
performance-based financing instruments for use by energy-intensive companies.  
Links with the financial performance of other parts of the energy sector 
The financial health of other parts of the energy and industrial sectors has an impact on 
financing conditions for clean energy investments because there are limits to the capacity 
of banks to mobilise debt for investments. Industry, infrastructure and power remain the 
largest recipients of bank credit in absolute terms, but lending has stagnated over the past 
five years, with most growth occurring in the personal and services sectors. Moreover, 
while overall bank credit has grown by 40% since the start of 2016, it has stalled with the 
start of the pandemic.  
One reason for the stagnation in recent years is that the RBI has prescribed sector limits to 
guard against concentration of credit risks, and these limit bank loan portfolios for 
infrastructure, including power, to 20-25%. Another reason is the high level of stressed 
assets now in the financial system, which is creating headwinds for overall lending. Nearly 
15% of bank portfolios in industry and power remain stressed, and the stressed assets 
include over 50 GW of existing coal power plants due to a lack of availability of PPAs and 
coal supply contracts, as well as declining fleet utilisation rates. Exposure to gross non-
performing assets in the electricity sector alone stood at over $10 billion in early 2020, with 
a further $8 billion in metals, $4 billion in construction and $1 billion in mining.  
The high level of stressed assets represents an important risk for India's energy transition 
because it dampens liquidity in the economy and crowds out funds for utility-scale 
renewables and large-scale investments. While a decline in final investment decisions for 
thermal power plants in recent years stems from the shifting role of coal and the rise of 
renewables in India's energy system, it also reflects increased risk aversion by banks. This 
risk aversion also affects the financing of gas power capacity, which would need to step up 
in the SDS, and of retrofits and refurbishments of power and industrial plants. For example, 
banks appear reluctant to fund investment in emissions control equipment of $7 billion for 
120 GW of coal power seeking to comply with more stringent environmental rules.  
Figure 4.23 ? Growth in bank credit deployed by sector (left), share of stressed 
assets in bank portfolios (middle) and thermal power FIDs (right)  
 
 
After easing conditions in the past two years, the pandemic and a high level of energyrelated 
stressed assets in the financial system are creating new headwinds for lending.  
 
Notes: FID = final investment decision; 1H = first half. Stressed assets are defined by the RBI as those with 
delays in the payment of their interest and/or principal by the stipulated date in the loan repayment 
schedule.  Source: IEA analysis based on Reserve Bank of India (2020) and McCoy Power Reports (2020).  
Improving the situation requires a multifaceted approach. In addition to efforts to improve 
the performance of the distribution sector, and coal supply, enhancements to market 
design and interconnection to facilitate the more flexible use of the thermal generation 
fleet could unlock additional value in financially stressed assets and the power system, 
while the expedited retirement of the oldest, lowest-efficiency and least system-relevant 
coal power plants could help ease financial strain on newer plants. From a financial 
standpoint, greater flexibility in the rules and regulations around stressed assets would help 
matters, as would separate treatment of renewables and other clean energy projects within 
sectoral lending limits. Greater use of new financial mechanisms, such as off-balance-sheet 
refinancing through the capital markets, could also help with the management of economic 
burdens caused by unprofitable assets (IEA, 2020d). 
4.4 	India in global energy 
India already has a seat at the top table of international energy affairs, and its role is set to 
increase in importance in the years ahead. In this section, we consider different aspects of 
the interactions between India and the global energy economy, ranging from the impacts of 
Covid-19, market balances and energy security through to clean technology development 
and emissions. 
4.4.1 	India in global energy markets, trade and security  
India is the fourth-largest global energy consumer today, after China, the United States and 
the European Union, and in the STEPS it overtakes the European Union by 2030 to move up 
to third position. This is underpinned by a rate of GDP growth that adds the equivalent of 
another Japan to the world economy by 2040.  
Figure 4.24 ? Change in total primary energy demand and electricity generation in 
selected regions in the STEPS, 2019-2040 
 
India sees demand grow across the energy sector through to 2040, and its increasing 
requirements for coal and oil partially offset reductions in advanced economies. 
 
India accounts for nearly one-quarter of global energy demand growth from 2019-40 in the 
STEPS, the largest of any country. As such, its influence in global energy affairs is felt across 
all fuels and technologies (Figure 4.24). India's share in the growth in renewable energy in 
the STEPS is the second-largest in the world, after China. Already a heavyweight in solar PV, 
India takes on a similar role in battery storage, attracting more than a third of global 
investment between 2019 and 2040. By 2040, India's power system is bigger than that of 
the European Union, and is the world's third-largest in terms of electricity generation; it 
also has 30% more installed renewables capacity than the United States. 
India likewise plays an extremely important role in global fuel markets. It leads oil demand 
growth, which rises over the period on the back of a fivefold increase in per capita car 
ownership. The country also becomes the fastest-growing market for natural gas, with 
demand more than tripling to 2040. India is one of the very few growth markets for coal in 
the STEPS, offsetting just over a quarter of the decrease in coal consumption in advanced 
economies. 
India's continued industrialisation becomes a major driving force for the global energy 
economy. Over the last three decades, India accounted for about 10% of world growth in 
industrial value-added (in PPP terms). In the STEPS to 2040, India is set to account for 
almost 20% of global growth in industrial value-added, and to lead global growth in 
industrial final energy consumption, especially in steelmaking; India accounts for nearly 
one-third of global industrial energy demand growth to 2040 (Figure 4.25). This pivot in the 
global industrial economy towards India has important implications for world energy 
markets, for example for coking coal and natural gas, but also for global efforts to mitigate 
CO2 in the industry sector. 
Figure 4.25 ? India's share in the growth of global industrial output and energy 
consumption by time period in the STEPS, 1990-2040 
 
In the STEPS, India becomes a global industrial heavyweight, and by 2040 it is producing 
almost 15% of the world's steel.  
 
The picture is similar in the IVC, although India's development model is based more heavily on 
renewables, efficiency and natural gas. India remains the largest source of global energy 
demand growth in the DRS as well, although an extended pandemic would be extremely 
damaging to India's development prospects (see Chapter 2). 
There is a sharp distinction to be made in the STEPS in terms of India's position in global 
energy trade between oil and gas, where the volumes and share of imported fuels rise 
steadily, and coal, where demand for imports is tempered by stagnant demand and 
relatively strong domestic output. India currently sources around 40% of its primary energy 
from abroad (360 Mtoe of imports out of a total of 935 Mtoe in 2019), a share that remains 
roughly constant in the STEPS. 
India's net dependence on oil imports - taking into account both the import of crude oil and 
the export of oil products - is around 75% today; this increases to more than 90% by 2040 
in the STEPS, as domestic consumption rises much more than production. Natural gas 
import dependency increased from 20% in 2010 to almost 50% in 2019, and is set to grow 
further to more than 60% in 2040 in STEPS. The dynamics look quite different for coal, 
where India's demand for imported coal barely gets back to pre-crisis levels over the next 
decade in the STEPS, and this has outsize implications for global trade. India currently 
accounts for 16% of global coal trade, and many global coal suppliers were counting on 
growth in India to underpin planned export-oriented mining investments. These 
expectations are now running up against India's determination to boost domestic 
production (see section 3.4), leaving relative certainty only over India's requirement to 
import coking coal for its rising steel production, together with steam coal for those coastal 
power generation plants that have been designed to receive imported grades. 
The combined import bill for fossil fuels triples in India over the next two decades in the 
STEPS, with oil making up by far the largest component of the total (Figure 4.26). As of 
2019, energy accounts for almost one-third of India's total imports by value, and this 
exposure to global energy prices and market volatility increases in the STEPS. This implies 
significant vulnerabilities for India, both in terms of import bills and the potential for 
disruption to supplies.  
The first of these vulnerabilities, while significant, has been mitigated to a degree by lower 
price trajectories in this year's outlook, which have reduced India's cumulative import bill to 
2040 by 20% compared with the WEO 2019. Lower prices and import bills have already 
provided a boost to India in 2020, providing much-needed economic relief (and allowing 
the Indian government to raise duties on transport fuels at the same time). Lower oil and 
gas prices could also help to accelerate fuel switching from coal to natural gas or from 
traditional biomass to LPG, although equally they could undermine investment in domestic 
resources and reduce incentives to improve efficiency, or to switch away from fossil fuels 
altogether.  
However, the shock of lower prices for major hydrocarbon exporters arguably increases the 
second of these vulnerabilities, the risks of disruptions to supply and market volatility. We 
estimate that net income from oil and gas in the Middle East, for example, fell by more than 
half in 2020, and year-on-year declines in net income for African producers on average are 
likely to be closer to 75%. These have exacerbated the fiscal strains facing many of these 
producer economies, leaving them with difficult choices on how to allocate scarce financial 
resources. Investment in new oil and gas supply around the world is expected to fall by 
around one-third in 2020, much more than the expected 9% drop in global oil demand and 
3% fall in gas consumption, and this raises the possibility of new price cycles in the future. 
Given that India relies heavily on Middle Eastern and African producers to meet its crude oil 
and natural gas requirements, possible disruption to supplies in these regions could be felt 
much more in India than in other economies. The risk of a shortfall in investment appears 
to be higher for oil than for natural gas, which saw record approvals of new LNG export 
facilities in 2019. This vulnerability is mitigated by a large stock-holding capacity at publicly 
owned refineries, as well as by the continued build-up of the Indian Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which currently has a capacity of 40 million barrels, roughly equivalent to 10 days' 
oil consumption. 
Figure 4.26 ? Value of domestic production and import bills for fossil fuels in India 
by scenario 
 
The growing import bill for fossil fuels in India implies significant vulnerability  to 
global energy prices and market volatility.  
 
There is a much more profound change in the SDS, in which efficiency and fuel switching 
reduce the 2040 import bill by more than 50% compared with the STEPS. However, there 
would still be a need for continued vigilance on traditional aspects of fuel security in this 
scenario as well, not least because most imports would come from a handful of major 
lowcost producers whose hydrocarbon-dependent economies would come under immense 
strain as the global energy economy shifted away from fossil fuels. 
Changing global energy dynamics and pathways for India point strongly towards the need 
for a broader concept of energy security that encompasses new and evolving risks to 
energy supply. To take one example, changes in India's electricity sector are dramatically 
increasing the need for flexibility in power system operation, as described in detail in 
Chapter 3: hourto-hour ramping requirements are set to more than double in India over the 
next decade in the STEPS, and the pace of transformation would be even more rapid in the 
SDS. Like other countries, India needs to ensure that institutional and regulatory changes in 
the power sector keep pace with the speed of technological change if it is to safeguard the 
security of its electricity supply. 
Another example concerns clean energy technologies. As described in more detail in the 
next section, India is set to become a major market for these technologies, and the 
government aims to capture a greater share of this demand through local production, using 
the leverage that India has as a leader in the deployment of battery storage and other clean 
energy technologies and as a country with a large and growing domestic market (Box 4.5). 
But this ambition raises questions about the adequacy of supplies of critical minerals. 
Managing the risks and geopolitical hazards associated with these increasingly important 
value chains will be an important task for India's policy makers and one where - as with 
other aspects of energy security - international collaboration can play a vitally important 
role. 
Box 4.5 ? 	India's oil refining sector: leveraging the large domestic market  
India's natural capital is as diverse as it is vast, but it still relies on imports for some key 
elements of the energy system. At present, its imports include oil products for transport 
and industrial applications, and natural gas.  
However, limited raw materials do not necessarily lead to a reliance on imports for final 
product, a point that is exemplified by India's refining industry. With the exception of 
one refinery processing Assam crude, India's oil product demand was met by imports 
until the 1950s (Tang, 1994). India then chose to develop a national refining sector and 
to import crude oil rather than refined oil products, encouraging partnerships between 
Indian and foreign companies to establish coastal refineries (initially designed to 
process Iranian crude). In the 25 years to 1982, refining capacity in India grew from 
around 80 kb/d to more than 750 kb/d.  
An initial consequence of this policy was the capture of more value in the supply chain 
by Indian companies (mostly PSUs). Following the opening of the Jamnagar refinery in 
1999 by the private Indian company Reliance Industries, India then became an exporter 
of oil products and almost eliminated imports of gasoline, diesel and kerosene (Figure 
4.27). By 2019, India's oil product exports generated around $3 billion dollars (UN, 
2020). In recent years, Indian refineries have been expanding further down the value 
chain towards petrochemicals to capture additional value. India's ethylene production 
has almost doubled to 6.6 Mt since 2015 and is set to grow further by two-thirds 
through to 2030 in the STEPS.  
Even without large crude oil resources, India has today developed a mature refining and 
downstream petroleum industry. In the STEPS, it overtakes Russia in the early 2030s to 
become the world's third-largest refining centre. The example of oil refining indicates 
how countries can move up the value chain where there is a strong strategic and 
economic rationale, especially where - as in this case - it is underpinned by a large and 
growing domestic market. 
Figure 4.27 ? India's trade in crude oil and oil products, 1973-2018 

 
 
 
  Investments in refining have increased imports of crude oil, reduced imports of oil 
products and moved India up the oil value chain, leading to exports of oil products. 

4.4.2 	India in global clean energy transitions 
India will soon become one of the world's largest markets for a range of clean energy 
technologies, making it a major target for technology developers looking for sales growth. 
In the STEPS, the Indian markets for solar PV modules, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries 
and water electrolysers together grow to around $40 billion per year by 2040. Lithium-ion 
batteries alone account for nearly a third of this total, with annual demand in 2040 equal to 
the output of more than 20 times the capacity of today's largest gigafactory. For each 
product, India represents a sizeable share of the global market - around 10% for lithium-ion 
batteries, 15% for wind turbines, and 30% for solar PV (Figure 4.28). In the STEPS, 1 in every 
7 dollars spent on these three types of equipment in 2040 is in India, compared with 1 in 20 
today. 
These trends are accelerated in the SDS, with the combined size of the markets in India 
almost doubling to around $80 billion in 2040 compared with the STEPS. However, as the 
faster deployment yields faster cost declines that stem from economies of scale, 
manufacturing improvements and other innovations, the growth in installed capacity is 
even larger. This is particularly notable in the case of solar PV: 12% more capacity is added 
from 2020 to 2040 in the SDS than in the STEPS, but the cost of this is just 6% higher. Faster 
deployment triggers a virtuous circle of investment, innovation, cost reductions and market 
growth that lowers the costs of energy transitions based on mass-produced technologies as 
they proceed. 
Currently, India is a net importer of products such as solar PV and batteries, with around $3 
billion of trade per year. India's manufacturing facilities for solar PV cells and modules have 
so far struggled to operate with high-capacity factors and compete with imports, especially 
those from China. Local production could potentially meet a greater share of demand in line 
with the government's policy goal of expanding domestic manufacturing. Some action has 
already been taken in pursuit of this goal. For example, contracts for 8 GW of solar PV were 
signed in 2020 under manufacturing-linked tenders that require the winner to undertake 
both project development and the setting up of new PV manufacturing facilities. In 
addition, India's first plant producing lithium-ion battery anodes was commissioned in 
Karnataka in mid-2020, while NITI Aayog's Advanced Chemistry Cell and 
Battery Gigafactory plan proposes incentives for developers of battery cell factories. 
India's markets for clean energy technologies grow rapidly in the STEPS, led by lithium-ion 
batteries. India's solar PV market accounts for around 25% of the global total in 2040. 
 
Note: Includes PV modules, wind turbines and battery packs only. Batteries includes both stationary and 
vehicle markets. 
Capturing value in these supply chains will be challenging. The most efficient manufacturers 
from around the world are likely to increase their focus on India as it takes a higher share of 
global markets. In addition, clean energy technology markets can be expected to remain 
highly dynamic and reliant on thin margins. PV cell and module production has been an 
extremely competitive business in recent years, for example, with many companies going 
bankrupt after failing to continually innovate or upgrade their assets. 
Innovation offers a way to increase the added value of clean technology markets. With 15-
30% of the global markets for some of these products, India could position itself as a hub 
for research expertise and a home for the associated intellectual property. Investments in 
research and development (R&D) and licensing of technologies could not only contribute to 
economic growth but also ensure that technologies are adapted to local contexts, taking 
account of climate, geography, grid requirements and the built environment.  
The value of innovation increases dramatically for countries and companies that target 
netzero GHG emissions, regardless of the time horizon. IEA analysis shows that around 35% 
of the cumulative CO2 emissions reductions needed to shift to a sustainable path come 
from technologies currently at the prototype or demonstration phase (IEA, 2020e). In 
addition, many clean energy technologies that are already established in parts of the 
marketplace need further adaptations to keep reducing costs and expand into new end 
uses. As a result, there is a great deal of scope for enhanced innovation efforts in areas that 
are expected to grow rapidly, such as solar PV and battery systems; areas that tap into 
India's skills, such as digital know-how; and areas critical to tackling future emissions 
challenges that currently lack solutions (Spotlight). For each area there are opportunities in 
different parts of the value chain from raw materials processing to component design and 
installation. Hydrogen is a good example of a technology area where a wide variety of skills 
will be needed beyond manufacturing, including some that share characteristics with 
petrochemicals production. 

S P O T L I G H T

India's net-zero challenge: addressing emissions, old and new 
In the SDS, India is on course to reach net-zero emissions in the mid-2060s. In order to 
do so, India, like other emerging market and developing economies, faces the twin 
challenge of avoiding emissions from its existing infrastructure, while limiting as much 
as possible the carbon footprint of new capital stock. These twin challenges call for the 
deployment of a wide range of different technologies and policy approaches.  
Two-thirds of India's total emissions over the period to 2040 in the STEPS come from 
power plants, factories, vehicles and buildings that exist today. By far the largest share 
of this comes from India's young and relatively inefficient coal-fired power fleet (Figure 
4.29). Emissions will also be strongly influenced in this scenario by industrial facilities 
commissioned as recently as the 2010s.  
If these existing plants and factories operate as planned, then the SDS is out of reach. 
This highlights the vital role for technologies that can help existing assets run more 
flexibly and efficiently, switch fuel inputs or capture their emissions. In the SDS, for 
example, the existing coal-fired fleet is either repurposed to provide system flexibility, 
co-fired with low-carbon fuels (mainly biomass), retrofitted with carbon capture and 
storage technology, or retired early.  
In the case of industrial facilities, adapting cement plants to enable CO2 capture is one 
example of technological efforts to reduce emissions from existing infrastructure, and 
replacing fossil fuels in steel production and refining with low-carbon hydrogen is 
another. In both cases, there is huge scope to develop new technologies and skills that 
are fit for Indian plants, and this has inspired a proposal to install one of the world's 
largest CO2 capture systems at a cement plant in Tamil Nadu.

India faces the need to invest in a range of technologies capable of addressing both existing 
and new sources of CO2 emissions.

However, much more so than in advanced economies, India's future emissions profile 
depends heavily on infrastructure that has yet to be built or bought - especially in 
industry and transport. Because of India's dynamic growth and the twin forces of 
urbanisation and industrialisation discussed in Chapter 2, already by the late 2030s 
India's emissions in the STEPS from new factories, vehicles and other equipment 
overtake those from sources existing today. In the SDS, India keeps these emissions 
from new sources to a minimum, avoiding higher-carbon infrastructure via early action 
to prioritise investment in efficient, low-emissions technologies across all parts of the 
energy sector, alongside a strong focus on sustainable urban design and transport. In 
doing so, India pioneers a new, low-carbon model of development, with major co-
benefits for air quality, reduced energy import bills and increased clean energy jobs and 
industrial opportunities.  
A redoubled effort to promote clean energy innovation in India can play an important 
role in reaching SDS goals. India is currently drafting a new Science, Technology and 
Innovation Policy, which will be its first since 2013. Among the stated aims are to 
double the number of researchers and the level of public and private expenditure on 
R&D every five years, with energy as a priority topic (DST, 2020). A Science, Technology 
and Innovation Development Bank is proposed to direct strategic long-term 
investments, which could help catalyse progress in clean energy technology areas that 
reflect India's circumstances and needs.  
Building on the insights in this report, several clean energy technology areas can be 
identified as pivotal for reaching net-zero emissions, all of which present opportunities 
in the near term: 
?	Lithium-ion batteries. India becomes the world's largest market for batteries in the 
STEPS, IVC and SDS. Supply chains for lithium and cobalt are concentrated outside 
India, but battery recycling and reuse could be a major opportunity in India, which 
updated its battery waste management rules in 2020 in recognition of this issue 
(IEA, 2020b). 
?	CCUS. India's CO2 storage potential has not yet been properly mapped. Given the 
important role likely to be played by CCUS in a variety of sectors in India, if CO2 can 
be securely stored, there is a strong case for defining the potential and 
understanding how its geographic distribution might influence future investments 
in industry and power. 
?	Hydrogen. India has the potential to close the cost gap between hydrogen from 
electrolysis and natural gas more quickly than many other countries due to its 
relatively high gas prices and low-cost solar PV potential, but flexible electrolysis 
and cost-effective hydrogen storage will be essential to integrate hydrogen with 
variable renewables. Electrolysers share technical attributes with batteries and fuel 
cells, creating opportunities to co-locate research hubs and exploit synergies. 
?	Material efficiency. Action to minimise the material demands of an expanding 
stock of vehicles and buildings, including through lightweighting and recycling, has 
the potential to make a major contribution to India's energy future if it is integrated 
into planning and design. 
?	Digital innovation. India's information and communications technologies sector is a 
significant global player and has impressive strengths in digital technologies, which 
could do much to improve efficiency in energy systems (for example through 
shaping logistics to reduce diesel demand for freight transport) and to make energy 
systems smarter, helping to lower bills and integrate variable renewables. 
Bioenergy. India's agricultural sector contributes 17% of GDP and around 40% of 
overall employment. Its biomass resource is large and includes a considerable 
amount of agricultural waste. There is scope for India to build on its existing 
leadership in biotechnologies and the demonstration of advanced biofuel 
technologies, and potential for low-cost biomethane to meet two-thirds of gas 
demand in India by 2040. 
The size of the potential market and the scope for innovation means that what happens in 
India on clean energy technology will affect the world. India is not currently a major global 
player in energy R&D. Public spending on energy R&D has increased since India joined the 
Mission Innovation initiative, rising to around $670 million in 2019, but this remains low as 
a share of GDP compared with other major economies. Private sector R&D spending is also 
relatively low, with government funding often favouring public institutions and enterprises. 
India's innovation and market potential mean that it has nonetheless become a destination 
for inward investment by multinational energy companies in R&D facilities. 
A strategic approach to clean energy innovation in India, aligned with energy and industry 
objectives, would increase the chances of successful innovation. Where India sits in the 
value chain for key technologies will determine its trading partners and influence its trade 
patterns, which will in turn affect the location of its industrial investments. Many 
governments sought to boost their energy innovation systems in 2020 through the use of 
economic pandemic recovery plans that seek to improve future competitiveness. India has 
a range of options available in this context (IEA, 2020c). To take one example, the National 
Hydrogen Energy Mission proposed by the prime minister in November 2020 represents a 
near-term opportunity to take a strategic approach to an emerging international 
technology. 
An important step for India will be to review best practice in prioritising technologies and 
stimulating public and private innovation in the types of technologies needed for energy 
transitions.  Doing this in the context of emerging markets with limited budgets and 
without a long legacy of energy technology innovation will fill a critical knowledge gap. 
International co-operation through multilateral initiatives and partnerships with overseas 
expertise that build local competences are likely to be helpful, while creating new linkages 
between industry and higher education could improve the exchange of ideas. Finance will 
also be important, and there is scope to explore how international finance institutions 
might accommodate pre-commercial energy technology development. 
Smaller companies can be more agile than large incumbents when it comes to exploiting 
emerging market opportunities. However, the level of risk capital required for new energy 
technologies is often out of the reach of start-ups in the absence of government support. 
The Clean Energy International Incubation Centre, co-founded by the government as part of 
its work within Mission Innovation, is relevant in this context: it builds on the existing 
networks of incubators and investors in India, and also encourages researchers and start-
ups to partner with international researchers and incumbent companies to help access 
costly infrastructure and early-stage customers.  
If India were to become more successful at moving clean energy technologies from lab to 
market, the payback would be economic as well as environmental. In the IVC, for example, 
more batteries are installed and the industry sector invests in more CO2 capture because 
the economy is more dynamic and the technologies are cheaper. By 2040, the IVC is closer 
to the SDS than STEPS for deployment of these technologies.
