Increased production in the Permian region and, to a lesser extent, in the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico (GOM) drives our forecast growth in production. We base our forecast on our expectations of crude oil prices and infrastructure capacity additions.  ', 'Our forecast of crude oil production in the Permian increases by 470,000 bd to average 5.7 million bd in 2023. Completion of new natural gas pipelines will allow producers to transport more of the natural gas that is produced along with crude oil (associated natural gas) to market, removing a potential constraint on crude oil production. Producers currently flare some of the natural gas they produce. We forecast that crude oil production in the GOM will increase by 120,000 bd in 2023, while production in other regions of the United States (except for the Permian) declines slightly.  ', 'In 2024, we forecast that crude oil production in the Permian will increase by 350,000 bd, while production in the GOM declines slightly. We forecast that production in other U.S. crude oil-producing regions increases by 70,000 bd in 2024.

Despite declining crude oil prices, we expect the WTI price will remain high enough to support crude oil production growth, especially in the Permian, where data from the Dallas Fed Energy Survey indicate that average breakeven prices range from $50b to $54b.

 'In 2021, U.S. proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate increased 16% from 2020, totaling 44.4 billion barrels, according to our recently released Proved Reserves of Crude Oil and Natural Gas in the United States, Year-End 2021 report. Proved reserves decreased 19% in 2020 because of pandemic-related constraints on crude oil demand and production. In 2021, however, demand for petroleum and natural gas returned, prices rose, and proved reserves increased.', 'In 2021, proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate increased in each of the five states with the most U.S. oil reserves. Two of these states, New Mexico and Alaska, set new state records for proved reserves.', 'Proved reserves are operator estimates of the volumes of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.', "Texas is the state with the largest volume of proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate, and in 2021 it had the largest net increase in proved reserves in the United States. Proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate increased 12%, or 1.9 billion barrels, in Texas during 2021 and reached 18.6 billion barrels, which was slightly less than the state's 2019 record high. Proved reserves in New Mexico increased 39%, or 1.4 billion barrels, which was the second-largest increase on record for any state. The WolfcampBone Spring shale play in the Permian Basin remains the largest oil-producing shale play in the United States, and it sits on the border of Texas and New Mexico.

The previous record was 137.4 Bcf, set on January 1, 2018. Below-normal temperatures in mid- to late December increased demand for natural gas used for residential and commercial space heating and electric power generation. At the same time, natural gas production quickly fell because of mechanical issues caused by the cold temperatures.  ', 'From December 21 through December 26, 2022, a winter storm moved across North America, bringing blizzards, high winds, and extremely cold temperatures to a large portion of the United States. Increased demand for space heating in both the residential and commercial sectors was primarily met by natural gas. On those six days, residential and commercial sector natural gas consumption averaged 60.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), or 55% higher than the five-year (2017–21) average.  ', 'Natural gas consumption in the electric power sector averaged 37.8 Bcfd from December 21 through December 26, or 45% higher than the five-year average (26.0 Bcfd) for those days. Electric power utilities used more natural gas, coal, wind, and oil to meet the higher-than-average demand for electricity. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) reported record-high electric power generation during the winter storm.', 'Although U.S. natural gas demand increased, production fell. Dry natural gas production in the Lower 48 states dropped to a low of 82.5 Bcf on December 24, a 16% decrease (16.1 Bcfd) from December 21, according to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights. The last time U.S. natural gas production rapidly declined to this degree was during a February 2021 winter storm. Higher-than-average natural gas demand during the December storm was met by increasing both withdrawals from storage and pipeline imports from Canada.
